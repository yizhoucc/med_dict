The cancer is still present in the breast tissue after the initial surgery, and the margins are not clear, which means that more surgery is needed to remove the remaining cancer cells.\\n\\nThe patient's blood work showed that her kidney function is normal, and her vitamin D level is a bit low. Her CRP (a marker of inflammation) is slightly elevated, which may indicate that she has an underlying condition such as sarcoidosis.\\n\\nThe team also discussed the patient's joint pain, which is likely due to the chemotherapy she received. They recommended that she continue taking naproxen and acetaminophen as needed to manage the pain.\\n\\nThe patient's anemia is stable, and she will continue taking iron supplements. Her neuropathy (nerve damage) is still present, but she is not taking gabapentin, which is a medication that can help with nerve pain.\\n\\nThe team discussed the patient's treatment plan, which includes starting letrozole, a hormone therapy medication, and continuing naproxen, acetaminophen, and allegra. They also discussed the possibility of starting abemaciclib after radiation therapy.\\n\\nThe patient will have a DEXA scan to check her bone density and an MRA of her abdomen in a year to check for any changes in her blood vessels.
