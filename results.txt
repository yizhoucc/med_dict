TASK: Extract the 'Genetic Testing Plan' from the given 'Assessment/Plan' section.

1. Scope of section:
- First, find the 'Assessment/Plan' section of the note (usually the final section).
- Only look for plans that are clearly about FUTURE genetic or molecular TESTING.

2. What COUNTS as 'genetic or molecular testing':
- Diagnostic, prognostic, or predictive laboratory assays, such as:
  - Tumor genomic sequencing / NGS / panel testing
  - Germline genetic panels (e.g., hereditary cancer panel, BRCA testing)
  - Liquid biopsy / circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) tests
  - Specific biomarker tests (e.g., PD-L1 testing, MSI testing, EGFR mutation testing)

3. What MUST be EXCLUDED:
- DO NOT include any medications, systemic therapies, or treatment plans:
  - Chemotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted therapies (e.g., FGFR inhibitor, PARP inhibitor, CDK4/6 inhibitor, TKIs)
  - Hormonal therapy, radiation therapy, surgery
  - Clinical trial options, even if the trial involves targeted drugs or inhibitors
- DO NOT include tests that are already completed, historic, or only mentioned in past oncology history.
- DO NOT include imaging (CT, PET, MRI, X-ray, ultrasound) or routine labs (CBC, CMP).

4. If there is NO new genetic or molecular test planned in the Assessment/Plan:
- Set the value to a clear negative statement, for example:
  "No new genetic or molecular tests were planned during this visit."
