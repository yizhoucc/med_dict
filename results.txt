Patient name  ***** *****     Date of service  07/07/2021        Date of last visit:  05/26/2021        Subjective          ***** ***** is a 48 y.o. post-menopausal female who presents with ***** *****/PR+ *****  IDC of the right breast. She has a history of endometriosis and recent total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral *****. She completed Taxol ***** followed by ***** on 05/26/21.         INTERVAL HISTORY AND RELEVANT SYMPTOMS    Underwent right lumpectomy sentinel LN with bil mastopexy on June 25 with Dr. *****. She's having a hard time with the path report. She knows she has to go back for positive margines. Waiting to hear back about schedule.     Her left port incision is still red. Sensitive to touch but to pain. No s/sx infection. Port removed July 08.     Nails lifted and hyperpigmented but they're growing.     Numbness in fingertips which extend May 28 down to the fingers. Worse in bil index fingers.  Was on gabapentin 600 mg after her abd surgery but had a hard time coming off. Her mood was affected. Skin and hand is better. Does not feel burned anymore. \n     No N/V. Stopped omeprazole. BM normal. Eating ok.     Occasional dizziness last few days. Thinks she's hydrating well.     Body aches in her upper body is improving. Continues naproxen bid. Right hand joint pain, especially in her thumb. Saw rheumatology and didn't think it was autoimmune related. Referred to PT, but PT is only taking pts post surgery and not hand, but has agreed to see her.       Specialty Problems        Malignant Neoplasms    1. Malignant neoplasm of overlapping sites of right breast in female,   estrogen receptor positive (CMS code)     Overview      10/11/20: Presented to the ED with abdominal discomfort, bloating and   indigestion. CT/AP showed 12.3 cm x 19.6 cm x 20.6 ***** mass of   suspected ovarian origin for which she was referred to ***** *****.   11/14/20: Underwent exploratory laparotomy, *****-BSO, pelvic washings as   well as biopsy of a R breast mass (***** reported lump prior to   surgery).  *****-BSO specimens consistent with leiomyomas and adenomyosis,   no evidence of malignancy. Pelvic washing negative. In the OR underwent   core biopsy of the palpable breast mass.     Breast onc history:    11/14/2020: Surgical pathology from intra-op R breast biopsy -  IDC,   modified ***** grade 2,  ER+ (98%), PR +(25%), ***** IHC 2+, FISH negative,   ***** 5%     11/11/2020: CT chest with two solid 0.2 cm pulmonary nodules in R middle   and lower lobes, mildly enlarged R axillary lymph nodes and enlarged (1.3   cm) retroperitoneal lymph nodes    12/10/2020: Bilateral diagnostic mammography with tomosynthesis, limited   right breast ultrasound. Mammogram found there is an irregular spiculated   mass with associated fine pleomorphic microcalcifications in the right   breast, upper inner quadrant, anterior third. No mammographic features of   malignancy in the left breast. Ultrasound demonstrated a 38 x 27 x 16 mm   hypoechoic, irregularly shaped solid mass with spiculated margins, in the \n   right breast, upper inner quadrant, 1:00, 1 cm from nipple. Right axilla   demonstrated several enlarged lymph nodes with cortical thickening   measuring up to 4 mm. There is an 11 x 11 x 9 mm right axillary node with   irregular shape and indistinct margins, suspicious for extranodal disease   extension.    12/10/2020 FNA of enlarged R axillary node consistent with metastatic   carcinoma    12/23/2020 MRI breast:  1. A 38 mm right upper inner quadrant breast mass corresponds to proven   malignancy. No evidence of multifocal disease or contralateral   malignancy. Recommend continued surgical and oncologic management.  2. Right level April 26 axillary adenopathy corresponds to proven metastatic   disease.  3. Nonspecific 5 mm enhancing lesion within the right upper sternum,   without apparent correlate on ***** ***** of 11/11/2020. Recommend   correlation with bone scan or PET/CT.  4. Suggestion of enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes, which appear   more prominent in comparison to the prior CT of 11/11/20, although   comparison is limited due to differences in technique. Suggest   correlation with CT or PET/CT.    12/31/20 PET/CT: 1. Baseline PET/CT demonstrates hypermetabolic right breast   mass consistent with known invasive ductal carcinoma. Associated   hypermetabolic right axillary, right internal mammary, and possible right   anterior chest wall metastases.  Additional extensive fat stranding along   the right upper extremity neurovascular bundle raises the possibility of   brachial plexus involvement.   2.  Extensive hypermetabolic bilateral hilar and mediastinal   lymphadenopathy in a pattern most suggestive of sarcoidosis versus less   likely metastatic disease.   3.  *****-shaped hypodensities within the left greater than right kidneys,   favoring pyelonephritis versus less likely developing infarcts. Mild   circumferential urinary bladder wall thickening also may reflect urinary   tract infection. \n Recommend correlation with urinalysis and symptoms.  4.  Postsurgical changes from hysterectomy and bilateral   salpingo-oophorectomy. Associated hypodensity within the right ovarian   vein favored to represent thrombus versus less likely mixing artifact.    01/07/21 Renal/kidney u/s: Normal size bilateral kidneys. No hydronephrosis   or renal calculus noted. Of note, targeted Doppler interrogation   demonstrates region with relative decreased vascularity at the left lower   pole, corresponding to the site of ***** on ***** ***** scan.   Adjacent to this, a small round focus with abnormal turbulent pulsatile   flow is demonstrated.    01/08/21 CT angiogram abdomen: Left inferior renal artery vascular   irregularity with associated inferior pole hypoperfusion, likely   representing partially thrombosed dissection with aneurysm versus   pseudoaneurysm measuring up to 0.6 cm, not definitively seen on 10/11/2020   examination. Left hepatic lobe irregular 1.5 cm hypodensity, incompletely   characterized. Right middle lobe peripheral 0.4 cm lesion, increased in   prominence compared to 11/11/2020. Total abdominal hysterectomy/bilateral   salpingo-oophorectomy postsurgical changes with associated distal right   ovarian vein thrombosis. Prominent but not pathologically enlarged   periaortic lymph nodes.     01/09/21 Endobronchial biopsy: Benign bronchial tissue.  FNA: A.  Lymph node, station 11R, endobronchial ultrasound-guided fine   needle  aspiration biopsy: Non-necrotizing granulomatous inflammation; see   comment:  B.  Lymph node, station 7, endobronchial ultrasound-guided fine needle  aspiration biopsy: Non-necrotizing granulomatous inflammation; see   comment:  C.  Lymph node, station 11L, endobronchial ultrasound-guided fine needle  aspiration biopsy: Non-necrotizing granulomatous inflammation; see   comment:    01/09/21 Invitae genetic testing: Pathogenic variant in *****. Variant of   uncertain significance in \n WRN      01/14/21 ***** abdomen: 1.  No MRI correlate to the previously described 1.5   cm hypodensity within the left hepatic lobe. The previously described   vascular irregularity of the left inferior renal artery is seen, but   better characterized on prior CTA exam.    01/20/21 start neoadjuvant taxol ***** followed by *****    06/02/21 ***** *****: RIGHT Breast: Interval decrease in volume, extent and   avidity of enhancement of the known right upper inner malignancy with   residual segmental non-mass enhancement measuring up to 28 x 10 x 25 mm   (AP x trans x CC extent) on MIP images (previously measuring up to 38 x 14   x 29 mm).   Kinetic evaluation demonstrates slow initial rise with delayed   persistent enhancement.  Biopsy clip artifact is noted along the   anterolateral margin of the non-mass enhancement (axial T1 non-FS image   46). LEFT Breast: No abnormal areas of enhancement or other MRI features   of malignancy are identified. OTHER: Decrease in size of right level I and   II axillary adenopathy with biopsy clip artifact within a biopsy proven   nodal metastasis (axial T2 image 138). No left axillary adenopathy.

This time includes time spent with the patient as well as time spent documenting in the medical record, reviewing patient's records and tests, obtaining history, placing orders, communicating with other healthcare professionals, counseling the patient, family, or caregiver, and/or care coordination for the diagnoses above.    Assessment/Plan\n I personally reviewed and interpreted each of the patient's relevant lab tests as outlined here with the following findings:   Office Visit on 06/22/2021   Component Date Value Ref Range Status   \u0007 Albumin, Serum / Plasma 06/22/2021 3.9  3.5 - 5.0 g/dL Final   \u0007 Alkaline Phosphatase 06/22/2021 ***** 38 - 108 U/L Final   \u0007 Alanine transaminase 06/22/2021 22  10 - 61 U/L Final   \u0007 AST 06/22/2021 19  5 - 44 U/L Final   \u0007 Bilirubin, Total 06/22/2021 0.3  0.2 - 1.2 mg/dL Final   \u0007 Urea Nitrogen, Serum / Plasma 06/22/2021 15  7 - 25 mg/dL Final   \u0007 Calcium, total, Serum / Plasma 06/22/2021 10.0  8.4 - 10.5 mg/dL Final   \u0007 Chloride, Serum / Plasma 06/22/2021 *****  101 - 110 mmol/L Final   \u0007 Creatinine 06/22/2021 0.62  0.55 - 1.02 mg/dL Final   \u0007 eGFR - low estimate 06/22/2021 *****  >59 mL/min Final    Comment: The eGFR is likely between the \"eGFR-low estimate\" result and the \"eGFR-high estimate\" result, provided the serum creatinine is stable and with the following noted:                                            1. Serum creatinine level is affected by multiple factors besides GFR, including creatinine generation (which is correlated primarily with muscle mass) and renal tubular secretion of creatinine (which can be affected by certain medications). Thus, the   actual GFR for patients with poor nutritional status \n or limb amputation may be lower than the lower end of this range.  It may be on the higher end of this range for patients who are very muscular or take medications that decrease creatinine secretion (e.g. trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, certain HIV medications).                                            2. Previously, results were reported as \"non-African-American\" or \"African-American\", because in the development of commonly used creatinine-based eGFR equations, self-reported Afr                           ***** Americans had higher serum creatinine level on average for a given   measured GFR (iothalamate clearance) compared to other included groups.  However, use of race in these equations is flawed for multiple reasons, including that classification of race is based on sociopolitical considerations and not justified by biology.                                            Given the above, in situations where the absolute eGFR value will directly affect clinical decision-making (e.g. medication dose or appropriateness), clinicians should consider using serum cystatin C to estimate GFR (which does not involve the   consideration of race), directly measure GFR and/or consult with nephrology.

"ID: ***** ***** is a 39 y.o. premenopausal patient with an oligo-metastatic *****+/*****- breast cancer and a BRCA2 mutation, treated with ***** and bilateral mastectomy/left ALND, returning to clinic for regular f/u.    Date of Service: 04/30/18    Interim History:  - The patient was last seen in clinic on 04/02/18. She reports feeling better and being able to move more.    - She called in last week with concern because her incision macerated. She is continuing to have breast pain and soreness though it is improving.    - She started PT. She states that it was painful initially, but she does practice the exercises 3 x day. Her goal is to have pre-op range of motion. She has also increased her walking.    - Since starting letrozole, she notices more joint pain on feet (prior on knees only) mostly in the morning. In the beginning it was difficult to walk but she is adjusting.    - She also notes nausea in the afternoon that might have been caused by oxycodone. She is still taking oxycodone a day and her goal is to wean off it soon.     - She notes some hair thinning since starting treatment.    - She has numbness on her right foot toe pads (#***** ***** #*****). She has *****/needles on the rest of the right foot and left foot.    - She continues to have hot flashes, but adjusts to it by varying how much clothes she wears at night.  She has an appointment for her first acupuncture session.     - She is weaning Ativan and using it only when needed and ***** by increasing melatonin (20mg).and trazodone (50mg).    - She is thinking about returning to work. She was a charge nurse and worked nights on a general surgery floor. From a financial point she needs to work and she wants to return. She is looking to transition to the clinic setting.    - She is finding support in a FB group but describes it as a \"*****-hate\" because exposure to other stories causes some worry.    - See below for additional review of systems.

"Patient Name: ***** *****  ***** *****: 08/22/19    ***** ***** is a 45 year old female with recently diagnosed breast cancer who is here for a consultation regarding further management.     HPI    ***** has a prior history of breast abnormalities with biopsy confirmed left fibroadenoma in 2017. She developed bilateral breast pain in November 2018.

Left axillary LN core biopsy = metastatic adenoca  June 2019 - bone scan = negative  June 2019 - CT (C/A/P) = left breast 2.4cm tumor with left axillary ***** up to 1.7cm and ***** left *****. No distant mets  June 2019 - PET-CT = intensely hypermetabolic left breast tumor, Axillary and subpectoral *****, and small *****. Tiny left 5th rib lytic with faint FDG. Incidental findings of physiologic FDG in left adnexa and fat necrosis in central pelvis  July 2019 - cardiac echo = normal, EF=63%  July 2019 - ***** genetics 34-***** panel = negative, except VUS in *****    ***** started on neo-adjuvant AC/taxol 2 weeks ago with GCSF support d3-9. She has tolerated this well with only mild symptoms of nausea/vomiting.    PMH  none    Meds  Zofran PRN    Allergies  none    Social History  ***** does fundraising and business development for a non-profit and is on leave.  She is married without children, had two miscarriages.  She is a former 3PY smoker quit in 2016. EtOH 8 glasses/week until recently, now does not drink since cancer diagnosis. Occasional pot \n user, currently on some CBD program to manage symptoms.    Family History  father with colon cancer @*****  ***** ***** #***** with unknown cancer died @60s  paternal aunt #2 with unknown cancer died @60s  paternal grandmother with unknown cancer died @60s    Review of Systems   Constitutional: Negative.  Negative for chills, fever and weight loss.   HENT: Negative.  Negative for congestion, hearing loss and sore throat.    Eyes: Negative.    Respiratory: Negative for cough and shortness of breath.    Cardiovascular: Negative.    Gastrointestinal: Positive for nausea and vomiting. Negative for constipation and diarrhea.   Skin: Negative for itching and rash.   Neurological: Negative for dizziness, weakness and headaches.     Physical Exam:  This was a video visit    Impression  ***** clinical prognostic stage IIIB (*****) left breast cancer, ER/PR positive, ***** negative    Assessment/Plan:  Status of disease and management recommendations were discussed at length with *****. She has a cancer that is locally advanced. The rib finding on the PET scan may or may not be a site of metastasis, but it is too subtle and too late to attempt a biopsy with high confidence. Therefore I think the stage IIIB staging is reasonable to pursue at this time. Should more convincing and accessible sites of distant metastasis present themselves in the future, this can be pursued with the appropriate diagnostic biopsies and the stage revised if necessary.    ***** has a high risk of systemic relapse and mortality from this cancer if it is managed by surgery alone, a risk that I estimate to be greater than 80%. This can be reduced by several modalities including chemotherapy, hormone therapy, bone therapy, radiotherapy, and possibly newer modalities under investigation. These were discussed individually.     Chemotherapy can substantially reduced her risk of recurrence and mortality from this cancer and was recommended. Chemotherapy can be \n administered in the adjuvant or neoadjuvant settings with equivalent benefits on long term outcomes outcomes (***** ***** *****; ***** ***** *****; ***** ***** *****). However there are certain advantages to the neoadjuvant timing. These include the opportunity to confirm the in ***** response, the powerful prognostic information provided by pathologic response status (***** ***** *****; ***** ***** *****; ***** ***** *****; ***** ***** *****; ***** ***** *****), and the opportunity for salvage therapies or clinical trials should there be extensive residual disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy ***** a high risk of relapse.  She has already started on neo-adjuvant AC/taxol chemotherapy and I concurred with this (***** ***** *****; ***** ***** *****). This consists of 4 cycles of AC at 60/600 mg/m2 given every 2 weeks with growth factor support followed by taxol given either in 4 doses of 175mg/m2 q2weeks or in 12 weekly doses of 80mg/m2. Side effects were discussed including a potential for nausea, vomiting, alopecia, immune suppression and infections, fatigue, neuropathy. Long term sequelae include 1-2% incidence of cardiomyopathy (***** ***** *****; ***** ***** *****) and 0.5% incidence of secondary myeloid neoplasms (***** ***** *****).     ***** will be having surgery after the completion of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. Considering her locally advanced disease, it may be wise to perform an axillary dissection, and if feasible, to identify and remove the subpectoral LNs as well. The feasibility of this is best determined by ***** and may require a repeat scan post-chemo to determine the extent of residual macroscopic disease. ***** refer to ***** at ***** should she wish to pursue surgery here.     ***** will benefit from adjuvant hormonal therapy for a duration of up to 10 years. Both tamoxifen and AIs are effective with AIs showing superior efficacy \n in randomized trials (***** ***** *****)(***** ***** *****). Side effects of tamoxifen were discussed including potential for hot flashes, mood effects, increased incidence of thromboembolic events and endometrial cancer in postmenopausal women. Side effects of AIs were discussed including *****, myalgias, and potential acceleration of bone loss. Although AIs are restricted to the postmenopausal state, ***** has high risk disease and will benefit from the superior efficacy afforded by AIs. This was confirmed in the combined analysis of the SOFT and TEXT trials wherein ovarian suppression with aromatase inhibitor therapy was the optimal hormonal therapy modality in premenopausal patients (***** ***** *****). ***** will likely be peri-menopausal at the completion of chemotherapy and may require ovarian suppression for a period of time. Alternatively ***** therapy with continuous estradiol monitoring for a period of time may establish a permanent menopausal status without the need for suppression.    The bone loss associated with postmenopausal use of AIs can be ***** with anti-resorptive bone agents. In addition to beneficial effects on bone, the use of ***** or denosumab every 6 months for 3 years in post-menopausal patients with early stage breast cancer is associated with a significant reduction in breast cancer recurrence (***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** *****), providing additional benefit to their use in this patient population. Side effects of zoledronic acid and denosumab were discussed including a rare risk of ***** with no cases confirmed in the *****-12 or *****-18 studies (***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** *****), but 2% in the more intense schedule of the ***** trial (***** ***** *****), and a rare risk of atypical femoral fractures at a rate of under 0.2% (***** ***** *****) with no cases confirmed in the *****-18 study (***** ***** *****). Zoledronic infusions \n can also be associated with flu-like symptoms typically with the first infusion.    In addition, we discussed the emerging role of ***** inhibitor therapy in the treatment of ER positive breast cancer. The addition of ***** inhibitors is associated with significant DFS and survival benefit in patients with metastatic breast cancer (***** ***** *****; ***** ***** *****). Phase 3 studies in early stage breast cancer have been completed but the outcomes data are not yet available. Press releases from ***** and ***** ***** have reported mixed results for adjuvant palbociclib and abemaciclib. This may be due to differences in risk categories accrued or may be due to differences in the agents or other study designs and can only be intelligently evaluated when the data is presented or published. The ribociclib phase 3 study is open at ***** (*****) and this remains an option should it still be open to accrual when ***** reaches her hormone therapy period. Alternatively ***** inhibitors may be used off label in this high risk case with her knowledge and consent.    ***** will benefit from post-operative radiotherapy whether she ***** breast-conserving surgery or mastectomy.  The high risk nature of her disease including the extensive LN involvement portend a high risk of local relapse and mortality that can be reduced by RT even in the post-mastectomy setting (***** ***** *****). In addition to the treatment of the breast or chest wall and regional LNs, ***** may chose to treat the semi-suspicious left lateral rib lesion with stereotactic RT. Indeed the management of oligometastatic breast cancer with stereotactic radiation approaches can result in considerable durations of disease control and survival, ***** when the oligometastatic site is in bone (***** ***** *****)(***** ***** *****)(***** ***** *****)(***** Int J Radiat ***** Biol Phys 2019; 104:1194).    ***** will be continuing her \n management at ***** and will return to us as needed for additional consultations. Today's consultation was based on the available medical records. Slides or images were not provided or reviewed for confirmation of the reported findings.     Seen and discussed with Dr. ***** *****    ***** performed this consultation using real-time Telehealth tools, including a live video connection between my location and the patient's location. Prior to initiating the consultation, I obtained informed verbal consent to perform this consultation using Telehealth tools and answered all the questions about the Telehealth interaction.    I reviewed old records and/or communicated with other professionals or the patient's family or the patient for a total of 30 minutes on date 08/22/2019.  This is directly related to a face-to-face visit encounter (Evaluation and Management service) I personally provided today.  CPT codes for billing for prolonged evaluation and management service (non-face-to-face review of records or communications with patient's family or other medical professionals):  ***** for 30-74 minutes total non-face-to-face time  Non-UCSF records I reviewed include Care Everywhere records: imaging, pathology, visits, and genetics.    \n"

The addition of ***** inhibitors is associated with significant DFS and survival benefit in patients with metastatic breast cancer (***** ***** *****; ***** ***** *****). Phase 3 studies in early stage breast cancer have been completed but the outcomes data are not yet available. Press releases from ***** and ***** ***** have reported mixed results for adjuvant palbociclib and abemaciclib. This may be due to differences in risk categories accrued or may be due to differences in the agents or other study designs and can only be intelligently evaluated when the data is presented or published. The ribociclib phase 3 study is open at ***** (*****) and this remains an option should it still be open to accrual when ***** reaches her hormone therapy period. Alternatively ***** inhibitors may be used off label in this high risk case with her knowledge and consent.    ***** will benefit from post-operative radiotherapy whether she ***** breast-conserving surgery or mastectomy.  The high risk nature of her disease including the extensive LN involvement portend a high risk of local relapse and mortality that can be reduced by RT even in the post-mastectomy setting (***** ***** *****). In addition to the treatment of the breast or chest wall and regional LNs, ***** may chose to treat the semi-suspicious left lateral rib lesion with stereotactic RT. Indeed the management of oligometastatic breast cancer with stereotactic radiation approaches can result in considerable durations of disease control and survival, ***** when the oligometastatic site is in bone (***** ***** *****)(***** ***** *****)(***** ***** *****)(***** Int J Radiat ***** Biol Phys 2019; 104:1194).    ***** will be continuing her \n management at ***** and will return to us as needed for additional consultations. Today's consultation was based on the available medical records. Slides or images were not provided or reviewed for confirmation of the reported findings.     Seen and discussed with Dr. ***** *****    ***** performed this consultation using real-time Telehealth tools, including a live video connection between my location and the patient's location. Prior to initiating the consultation, I obtained informed verbal consent to perform this consultation using Telehealth tools and answered all the questions about the Telehealth interaction.    I reviewed old records and/or communicated with other professionals or the patient's family or the patient for a total of 30 minutes on date 08/22/2019.  This is directly related to a face-to-face visit encounter (Evaluation and Management service) I personally provided today.  CPT codes for billing for prolonged evaluation and management service (non-face-to-face review of records or communications with patient's family or other medical professionals):  ***** for 30-74 minutes total non-face-to-face time  Non-UCSF records I reviewed include Care Everywhere records: imaging, pathology, visits, and genetics.    Assessment/Plan:  Status of disease and management recommendations were discussed at length with *****. She has a cancer that is locally advanced. The rib finding on the PET scan may or may not be a site of metastasis, but it is too subtle and too late to attempt a biopsy with high confidence. Therefore I think the stage IIIB staging is reasonable to pursue at this time. Should more convincing and accessible sites of distant metastasis present themselves in the future, this can be pursued with the appropriate diagnostic biopsies and the stage revised if necessary.    ***** has a high risk of systemic relapse and mortality from this cancer if it is managed by surgery alone, a risk that I estimate to be greater than 80%. This can be reduced by several modalities including chemotherapy, hormone therapy, bone therapy, radiotherapy, and possibly newer modalities under investigation. These were discussed individually.     Chemotherapy can substantially reduced her risk of recurrence and mortality from this cancer and was recommended. Chemotherapy can be \n administered in the adjuvant or neoadjuvant settings with equivalent benefits on long term outcomes outcomes (***** ***** *****; ***** ***** *****; ***** ***** *****). However there are certain advantages to the neoadjuvant timing. These include the opportunity to confirm the in ***** response, the powerful prognostic information provided by pathologic response status (***** ***** *****; ***** ***** *****; ***** ***** *****; ***** ***** *****; ***** ***** *****), and the opportunity for salvage therapies or clinical trials should there be extensive residual disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy ***** a high risk of relapse.  She has already started on neo-adjuvant AC/taxol chemotherapy and I concurred with this (***** ***** *****; ***** ***** *****). This consists of 4 cycles of AC at 60/600 mg/m2 given every 2 weeks with growth factor support followed by taxol given either in 4 doses of 175mg/m2 q2weeks or in 12 weekly doses of 80mg/m2. Side effects were discussed including a potential for nausea, vomiting, alopecia, immune suppression and infections, fatigue, neurop"

Stable diffuse osseous metastases. Diffuse irregular ***** enhancement along the bilateral cerebral convexities and right petroclival region, and nodular enhancement filling the right *****'s ***** is again seen and unchanged compared to 09/29/2020. This is presumed to represent metastatic disease. Since that study, there is increased involvement of the right internal auditory canal       *****, ***** reports that starting in late August, she developed decreased vision in her right eye. She reports double vision with gaze in certain positions. 3-4 weeks ago she also lost hearing in her right ear. Most recently, she developed dizziness, prompting an ED visit on 11/07/20. MRI brain showed that compared to an MRI brain from 09/29/20, there was largely unchanged ***** enhancement along the bilateral cerebral convexities and right petroclival region. The report did describe possible increase thickening in the right internal auditory canal.     She also has a history of MS, which was initially diagnosed in 1985. ***** reports that her MS presented with optic neuritis and loss of vision in her right eye. The optic neuritis resolved and her right eye vision has improved since that time. She has been wheelchair-bound since 2002 or 2003.

We had a lengthy discussion with the patient and her daughter which we reviewed her breast cancer diagnosis, workup and treatment history to date. I reviewed all of the relevant and available clinic notes, imaging, and pathology reports. First, we reviewed *****'s pathology confirming that she has metastatic breast cancer which is estrogen receptor positive \n and ***** negative based on core needle biopsy of an axillary LN in November 2019. She presented with extensive lytic bone lesions at that time. She has since developed metastatic disease to the liver and pachymeninges and possibly to the leptomeninges, although her first CSF cytology was negative for malignant cells. We explained that metastatic breast cancer is not curable, but it is treatable and there are therapies that will extend the quality and duration of life.     We reviewed her treatment course to date. She was initially started on letrozole/palbociclib in December 2019, but this was discontinued due to PD to the liver and LN in July 2020. WE assured ***** that this was an appropriate treatment choice as initial therapy of *****+/*****- metastatic disease. Upon progression, she was switched to Xeloda (initially 500mg BID inadvertantly, then 1000mg BID in mid-September, and 1500 mg BID since late September).     She recently had brain MRIs on 09/29/20 and again on 11/07/20, which showed diffuse irregular ***** enhancement along the bilateral cerebral convexities and right petroclival region as well as *****'s ***** The more recent scan showed possibly worsening of disease in the internal auditory canal, which would be consistent with her recent right hearing loss.  We tried to explain to the patient and family the difference between ***** based/***** disease and leptomeningeal disease and stressed that it can be very difficulty radiographically to distinguish the two. While her first CSF cytology was negative for malignant cells, her radiographic and clinical findings raise suspicion for leptomeningeal disease.    Recently, her neurologic symptoms are getting progressively worse, with no improvement in her vision and now auditory symptoms. Despite her initial CSF cytology being negative, we explained that  false negatives are not uncommon and we recommend repeat LP with cytology now. We also recommend referral to \n radiation oncology for consideration of radiation therapy (either just to her internal auditory canal or to a larger portion of her *****). We would also consider starting low dose steroids to see if this improves her symptoms.     In terms of future options, if a CT CAP shows clear progression on Xeloda, we would consider another hormone-based therapy strategy. We would consider fulvestrant plus the ***** inhibitor ***** (*****) (***** ***** 2019), given her known ***** mutation on Strata testing. In this study, in the cohort of patients with *****-mutated cancer, progression-free survival at a median follow-up of 20 months was 11.0 months in the *****-fulvestrant group, as compared with 5.7 months in the placebo-fulvestrant group. However, this regimen does not have great CNS penetration, but there are few regimens that do.    Given that she has metastatic disease to the bone, we agree with continuing zolendronic acid    Recommendations:  -- Repeat CT CAP now  -- Repeat LP for CSF cytology  -- Repeat MRI spine to r/o LMD in the spine  -- Recommend referral to radiation oncology to consider either focal CNS radiation or possible even *****. The patient is interested in a UCSF Rad Onc opinion as well.  -- Could consider starting low dose steroids to see if reduction of swelling improves any of her symptoms  -- Continue xeloda 1500mg BID for now  -- At time of progression of disease, could consider fulvestrant + ***** given the ***** mutation on STRATA testing  -- Continue zolendronic acid    Patient seen and discussed with breast oncology attending *****. ***** *****.    ***** *****, MD PGY-5  Hematology/Oncology Fellow    \n"

She has had ***** but no other imaging since her diagnosis for screening and was treated at *****.     She reports feeling discomfort and pressure in her waist and back for a few months and nausea and burping for a week.  She went to the ER and had a CT scan which shows widely metastatic cancer.  She has involvement of the lungs, peritoneum, liver and ovary with a local recurrence near the right axilla and implant.  She takes a long list of supplements which she will send to me.  She wants to have natural therapies.  She is very scared and appears anxious.  Her husband is here and very supportive.  We discussed how we need to get a biopsy to evaluate the phenotype of the cancer and she is agreeable.  I will set her up to see Dr. \n ***** this week for a biopsy of the right axilla in the office.
