Patient name  ***** *****     Date of service  07/07/2021        Date of last visit:  05/26/2021        Subjective          ***** ***** is a 48 y.o. post-menopausal female who presents with ***** *****/PR+ *****  IDC of the right breast. She has a history of endometriosis and recent total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral *****. She completed Taxol ***** followed by ***** on 05/26/21.         INTERVAL HISTORY AND RELEVANT SYMPTOMS    Underwent right lumpectomy sentinel LN with bil mastopexy on June 25 with Dr. *****. She's having a hard time with the path report. She knows she has to go back for positive margines. Waiting to hear back about schedule.     Her left port incision is still red. Sensitive to touch but to pain. No s/sx infection. Port removed July 08.     Nails lifted and hyperpigmented but they're growing.     Numbness in fingertips which extend May 28 down to the fingers. Worse in bil index fingers.  Was on gabapentin 600 mg after her abd surgery but had a hard time coming off. Her mood was affected. Skin and hand is better. Does not feel burned anymore. \n     No N/V. Stopped omeprazole. BM normal. Eating ok.     Occasional dizziness last few days. Thinks she's hydrating well.     Body aches in her upper body is improving. Continues naproxen bid. Right hand joint pain, especially in her thumb. Saw rheumatology and didn't think it was autoimmune related. Referred to PT, but PT is only taking pts post surgery and not hand, but has agreed to see her.       Specialty Problems        Malignant Neoplasms    1. Malignant neoplasm of overlapping sites of right breast in female,   estrogen receptor positive (CMS code)     Overview      10/11/20: Presented to the ED with abdominal discomfort, bloating and   indigestion. CT/AP showed 12.3 cm x 19.6 cm x 20.6 ***** mass of   suspected ovarian origin for which she was referred to ***** *****.   11/14/20: Underwent exploratory laparotomy, *****-BSO, pelvic washings as   well as biopsy of a R breast mass (***** reported lump prior to   surgery).  *****-BSO specimens consistent with leiomyomas and adenomyosis,   no evidence of malignancy. Pelvic washing negative. In the OR underwent   core biopsy of the palpable breast mass.     Breast onc history:    11/14/2020: Surgical pathology from intra-op R breast biopsy -  IDC,   modified ***** grade 2,  ER+ (98%), PR +(25%), ***** IHC 2+, FISH negative,   ***** 5%     11/11/2020: CT chest with two solid 0.2 cm pulmonary nodules in R middle   and lower lobes, mildly enlarged R axillary lymph nodes and enlarged (1.3   cm) retroperitoneal lymph nodes    12/10/2020: Bilateral diagnostic mammography with tomosynthesis, limited   right breast ultrasound. Mammogram found there is an irregular spiculated   mass with associated fine pleomorphic microcalcifications in the right   breast, upper inner quadrant, anterior third. No mammographic features of   malignancy in the left breast. Ultrasound demonstrated a 38 x 27 x 16 mm   hypoechoic, irregularly shaped solid mass with spiculated margins, in the \n   right breast, upper inner quadrant, 1:00, 1 cm from nipple. Right axilla   demonstrated several enlarged lymph nodes with cortical thickening   measuring up to 4 mm. There is an 11 x 11 x 9 mm right axillary node with   irregular shape and indistinct margins, suspicious for extranodal disease   extension.    12/10/2020 FNA of enlarged R axillary node consistent with metastatic   carcinoma    12/23/2020 MRI breast:  1. A 38 mm right upper inner quadrant breast mass corresponds to proven   malignancy. No evidence of multifocal disease or contralateral   malignancy. Recommend continued surgical and oncologic management.  2. Right level April 26 axillary adenopathy corresponds to proven metastatic   disease.  3. Nonspecific 5 mm enhancing lesion within the right upper sternum,   without apparent correlate on ***** ***** of 11/11/2020. Recommend   correlation with bone scan or PET/CT.  4. Suggestion of enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes, which appear   more prominent in comparison to the prior CT of 11/11/20, although   comparison is limited due to differences in technique. Suggest   correlation with CT or PET/CT.    12/31/20 PET/CT: 1. Baseline PET/CT demonstrates hypermetabolic right breast   mass consistent with known invasive ductal carcinoma. Associated   hypermetabolic right axillary, right internal mammary, and possible right   anterior chest wall metastases.  Additional extensive fat stranding along   the right upper extremity neurovascular bundle raises the possibility of   brachial plexus involvement.   2.  Extensive hypermetabolic bilateral hilar and mediastinal   lymphadenopathy in a pattern most suggestive of sarcoidosis versus less   likely metastatic disease.   3.  *****-shaped hypodensities within the left greater than right kidneys,   favoring pyelonephritis versus less likely developing infarcts. Mild   circumferential urinary bladder wall thickening also may reflect urinary   tract infection. \n Recommend correlation with urinalysis and symptoms.  4.  Postsurgical changes from hysterectomy and bilateral   salpingo-oophorectomy. Associated hypodensity within the right ovarian   vein favored to represent thrombus versus less likely mixing artifact.    01/07/21 Renal/kidney u/s: Normal size bilateral kidneys. No hydronephrosis   or renal calculus noted. Of note, targeted Doppler interrogation   demonstrates region with relative decreased vascularity at the left lower   pole, corresponding to the site of ***** on ***** ***** scan.   Adjacent to this, a small round focus with abnormal turbulent pulsatile   flow is demonstrated.    01/08/21 CT angiogram abdomen: Left inferior renal artery vascular   irregularity with associated inferior pole hypoperfusion, likely   representing partially thrombosed dissection with aneurysm versus   pseudoaneurysm measuring up to 0.6 cm, not definitively seen on 10/11/2020   examination. Left hepatic lobe irregular 1.5 cm hypodensity, incompletely   characterized. Right middle lobe peripheral 0.4 cm lesion, increased in   prominence compared to 11/11/2020. Total abdominal hysterectomy/bilateral   salpingo-oophorectomy postsurgical changes with associated distal right   ovarian vein thrombosis. Prominent but not pathologically enlarged   periaortic lymph nodes.     01/09/21 Endobronchial biopsy: Benign bronchial tissue.  FNA: A.  Lymph node, station 11R, endobronchial ultrasound-guided fine   needle  aspiration biopsy: Non-necrotizing granulomatous inflammation; see   comment:  B.  Lymph node, station 7, endobronchial ultrasound-guided fine needle  aspiration biopsy: Non-necrotizing granulomatous inflammation; see   comment:  C.  Lymph node, station 11L, endobronchial ultrasound-guided fine needle  aspiration biopsy: Non-necrotizing granulomatous inflammation; see   comment:    01/09/21 Invitae genetic testing: Pathogenic variant in *****. Variant of   uncertain significance in \n WRN      01/14/21 ***** abdomen: 1.  No MRI correlate to the previously described 1.5   cm hypodensity within the left hepatic lobe. The previously described   vascular irregularity of the left inferior renal artery is seen, but   better characterized on prior CTA exam.    01/20/21 start neoadjuvant taxol ***** followed by *****    06/02/21 ***** *****: RIGHT Breast: Interval decrease in volume, extent and   avidity of enhancement of the known right upper inner malignancy with   residual segmental non-mass enhancement measuring up to 28 x 10 x 25 mm   (AP x trans x CC extent) on MIP images (previously measuring up to 38 x 14   x 29 mm).   Kinetic evaluation demonstrates slow initial rise with delayed   persistent enhancement.  Biopsy clip artifact is noted along the   anterolateral margin of the non-mass enhancement (axial T1 non-FS image   46). LEFT Breast: No abnormal areas of enhancement or other MRI features   of malignancy are identified. OTHER: Decrease in size of right level I and   II axillary adenopathy with biopsy clip artifact within a biopsy proven   nodal metastasis (axial T2 image 138). No left axillary adenopathy.

This time includes time spent with the patient as well as time spent documenting in the medical record, reviewing patient's records and tests, obtaining history, placing orders, communicating with other healthcare professionals, counseling the patient, family, or caregiver, and/or care coordination for the diagnoses above.    Assessment/Plan\n I personally reviewed and interpreted each of the patient's relevant lab tests as outlined here with the following findings:   Office Visit on 06/22/2021   Component Date Value Ref Range Status   \u0007 Albumin, Serum / Plasma 06/22/2021 3.9  3.5 - 5.0 g/dL Final   \u0007 Alkaline Phosphatase 06/22/2021 ***** 38 - 108 U/L Final   \u0007 Alanine transaminase 06/22/2021 22  10 - 61 U/L Final   \u0007 AST 06/22/2021 19  5 - 44 U/L Final   \u0007 Bilirubin, Total 06/22/2021 0.3  0.2 - 1.2 mg/dL Final   \u0007 Urea Nitrogen, Serum / Plasma 06/22/2021 15  7 - 25 mg/dL Final   \u0007 Calcium, total, Serum / Plasma 06/22/2021 10.0  8.4 - 10.5 mg/dL Final   \u0007 Chloride, Serum / Plasma 06/22/2021 *****  101 - 110 mmol/L Final   \u0007 Creatinine 06/22/2021 0.62  0.55 - 1.02 mg/dL Final   \u0007 eGFR - low estimate 06/22/2021 *****  >59 mL/min Final    Comment: The eGFR is likely between the \"eGFR-low estimate\" result and the \"eGFR-high estimate\" result, provided the serum creatinine is stable and with the following noted:                                            1. Serum creatinine level is affected by multiple factors besides GFR, including creatinine generation (which is correlated primarily with muscle mass) and renal tubular secretion of creatinine (which can be affected by certain medications). Thus, the   actual GFR for patients with poor nutritional status \n or limb amputation may be lower than the lower end of this range.  It may be on the higher end of this range for patients who are very muscular or take medications that decrease creatinine secretion (e.g. trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, certain HIV medications).                                            2. Previously, results were reported as \"non-African-American\" or \"African-American\", because in the development of commonly used creatinine-based eGFR equations, self-reported Afr                           ***** Americans had higher serum creatinine level on average for a given   measured GFR (iothalamate clearance) compared to other included groups.  However, use of race in these equations is flawed for multiple reasons, including that classification of race is based on sociopolitical considerations and not justified by biology.                                            Given the above, in situations where the absolute eGFR value will directly affect clinical decision-making (e.g. medication dose or appropriateness), clinicians should consider using serum cystatin C to estimate GFR (which does not involve the   consideration of race), directly measure GFR and/or consult with nephrology.

"ID: ***** ***** is a 39 y.o. premenopausal patient with an oligo-metastatic *****+/*****- breast cancer and a BRCA2 mutation, treated with ***** and bilateral mastectomy/left ALND, returning to clinic for regular f/u.    Date of Service: 04/30/18    Interim History:  - The patient was last seen in clinic on 04/02/18. She reports feeling better and being able to move more.    - She called in last week with concern because her incision macerated. She is continuing to have breast pain and soreness though it is improving.    - She started PT. She states that it was painful initially, but she does practice the exercises 3 x day. Her goal is to have pre-op range of motion. She has also increased her walking.    - Since starting letrozole, she notices more joint pain on feet (prior on knees only) mostly in the morning. In the beginning it was difficult to walk but she is adjusting.    - She also notes nausea in the afternoon that might have been caused by oxycodone. She is still taking oxycodone a day and her goal is to wean off it soon.     - She notes some hair thinning since starting treatment.    - She has numbness on her right foot toe pads (#***** ***** #*****). She has *****/needles on the rest of the right foot and left foot.    - She continues to have hot flashes, but adjusts to it by varying how much clothes she wears at night.  She has an appointment for her first acupuncture session.     - She is weaning Ativan and using it only when needed and ***** by increasing melatonin (20mg).and trazodone (50mg).    - She is thinking about returning to work. She was a charge nurse and worked nights on a general surgery floor. From a financial point she needs to work and she wants to return. She is looking to transition to the clinic setting.    - She is finding support in a FB group but describes it as a \"*****-hate\" because exposure to other stories causes some worry.    - See below for additional review of systems.
