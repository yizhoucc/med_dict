  "What did we find": "Today, the team learned that the patient has metastatic breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body, including the lungs and lymph nodes. The cancer is called triple-negative breast cancer, which means it does not have estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, or excess HER2 protein. This type of cancer is not curable, but it is treatable.\n\nThe team also learned that the patient had a previous treatment with taxol, but the cancer did not respond to it. She had a lumpectomy and lymph node removal surgery in October 2020, and then had radiation and Xeloda treatment. However, the cancer continued to grow.\n\nThe team did not mention any new lab work or scans done during today's visit, but they did discuss the patient's current treatment plan and options for future treatment.",

If the cancer doesn't respond to this treatment, the doctor suggests using a different medication, such as a FGFR inhibitor, eribulin, or doxil.\n\n**Procedure Plan:**\nThe doctor recommends starting chemotherapy with Keynote 355 with Gemzar and carboplatin. In the future, the patient may be eligible for a clinical trial with a FGFR inhibitor.\n\n**Imaging Plan:**\nThere is no plan for future imaging mentioned in the note.\n\n**Lab Plan:**\nThe doctor recommends starting treatment with Keynote 355 with Gemzar and carboplatin as soon as possible. Future lab work may be needed to monitor the treatment response and disease progression.\n\n**Genetic Testing Plan:**\nThe patient's genetic testing was negative, which means she does not qualify for a PARP inhibitor.\n\n**Referral:**\nThe doctor recommends the following lifestyle changes to help manage the cancer and reduce the risk of recurrence:\n\n* Eating an anti-inflammatory and/or diabetes risk-reducing diet\n* Limiting alcohol\n* Exercising regularly\n* Reducing stress\n* Getting enough sleep",

Here's what the team learned:\n\nThe patient has invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) in her right breast, which is a type of breast cancer. The cancer is estrogen receptor-positive, which means that hormone therapy may be effective in treating it.\n\nThe team found that the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes in her right armpit, but not to other parts of her body. The cancer is still present in the breast tissue after the initial surgery, and the margins are not clear, which means that more surgery is needed to remove the remaining cancer cells.\n\nThe patient's blood work showed that her kidney function is normal, and her vitamin D level is a bit low. Her CRP (a marker of inflammation) is slightly elevated, which may indicate that she has an underlying condition such as sarcoidosis.\n\nThe team also discussed the patient's joint pain, which is likely due to the chemotherapy she received. They recommended that she continue taking naproxen and acetaminophen as needed to manage the pain.\n\nThe patient's anemia is stable, and she will continue taking iron supplements. Her neuropathy (nerve damage) is still present, but she is not taking gabapentin, which is a medication that can help with nerve pain.\n\nThe team discussed the patient's treatment plan, which includes starting letrozole, a hormone therapy medication, and continuing naproxen, acetaminophen, and allegra. They also discussed the possibility of starting abemaciclib after radiation therapy.\n\nThe patient will have a DEXA scan to check her bone density and an MRA of her abdomen in a year to check for any changes in her blood vessels. She will also have a follow-up MRI after the re-excision surgery and a follow-up PET/CT scan after radiation therapy.",
  "What is the plan": "Here are the next steps in plain language:\n\n**Medication Plan:**\n\n* Start taking letrozole\n* Continue taking naproxen 500mg twice a day\n* Take APAP as needed\n* Take allegra daily\n* Take tramadol as needed\n* Continue taking iron supplements\n* Get a baseline DEXA scan\n* Start taking abemaciclib after completing radiation therapy\n\n**Procedure Plan:**\n\n* Have a right breast re-excision of margins\n* Consider an axillary dissection\n* Have radiation therapy\n* Get a DEXA scan\n* Follow up with Dr. ***** for re-excision date\n* Follow up with Dr. ***** for sarcoidosis\n* Follow up with Dr. ***** for radiation oncology\n\n**Imaging Plan:**\n\n* Get a DEXA scan\n* Get an MRA of the abdomen in 1 year\n* Get a follow-up MRI after re-excision of margins\n* Get a follow-up PET/CT after radiation therapy\n\n**Lab Plan:**\n\n* Get a baseline DEXA scan\n* Get a CBC (complete blood count)\n* Get a CMP (complete metabolic panel)\n* Get tumor markers\n* Get a coagulation profile\n* Get sarcoid-related blood tests in the future (exact dates not specified)\n\n**Genetic Testing Plan:**\n\n* The patient has already had Invitae genetic testing, which showed a pathogenic variant in ***** and a variant of uncertainty in WRN. No further genetic testing is mentioned.\n\n**Referral:**\n\n* Physical therapy (for joint pain)\n* Radiation oncology (for radiation therapy)\n* Sarcoidosis specialist (for sarcoidosis management)\n* No referrals for nutrition or genetics are mentioned.",

  "What is the plan": "Here are the next steps in plain language:\n\n**Medication Plan:**\n\n* Continue taking Zofran as needed to manage nausea and vomiting.\n* Complete 4 cycles of chemotherapy (AC at 60/600 mg/m2 every 2 weeks with growth factor support) followed by taxol (either 4 doses of 175mg/m2 every 2 weeks or 12 weekly doses of 80mg/m2).\n* Start adjuvant hormonal therapy with an aromatase inhibitor (AI) for up to 10 years.\n* May require ovarian suppression for a period of time.\n* Consider using anti-resorptive bone agents (zoledronic acid or denosumab) to prevent bone loss.\n* May consider using CDK inhibitors (palbociclib, abemaciclib, or ribociclib) in the future.\n\n**Procedure Plan:**\n\n* Have surgery after completing chemotherapy.\n* May perform an axillary dissection and remove subpectoral lymph nodes if possible.\n* Have post-operative radiotherapy, regardless of whether breast-conserving surgery or mastectomy is done.\n* May choose to have stereotactic radiation therapy for the semi-suspicious left lateral rib lesion.\n\n**Imaging Plan:**\n\n* Have a repeat scan after chemotherapy to determine the extent of residual macroscopic disease.\n* May have stereotactic radiation therapy for the semi-suspicious left lateral rib lesion.\n* May have a DEXA scan to assess bone loss associated with postmenopausal use of AIs.\n\n**Lab Plan:**\n\n* Regular blood tests (CBC, CMP, tumor markers, coagulation profile) as needed.\n* May have a bone scan and CT scan in the future if distant metastasis is suspected.\n\n**Genetic Testing Plan:**\n\n* No specific plan mentioned for future genetic or molecular testing.\n\n**Referral:**\n\n* No specific referrals mentioned.",
  "Follow ups": "The patient will be continuing her management at ***** and will return to us as needed for additional consultations.",
  "Closing with Support": "I'm here to help you understand your cancer diagnosis and treatment options, and I'm committed to supporting you throughout this journey."

  "What did we find": "Today's visit was a follow-up to check on the patient's metastatic breast cancer. The team learned that the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, including the bones, liver, and possibly the meninges. \n\nThe team saw that the cancer is not responding well to the current treatment, as evidenced by the progression of the disease in the liver and lymph nodes, and worsening of symptoms. The patient's blood work showed that her liver function is stable, but her tumor markers are high.\n\nThe scans showed that the cancer is still present in the bones, liver, and possibly the meninges. The team also saw that the patient's symptoms, such as vision and hearing loss, are getting worse.",
