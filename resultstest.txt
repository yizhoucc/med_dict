There is retropulsion of fragment with narrowing of the spinal canal.  11/05/19: CT CAP: Pathologically enlarged right axillary and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, worrisome for metastatic disease. Extensive lytic/blastic osseous lesions scattered throughout the visualized axial and appendicular ***** with sternal body, multiple 
 vertebral body, right humeral neck, and left inferior pubic ramus/acetabular pathologic fracture deformities.  11/05/19: MRI total spine: C2 pathologic burst fracture with fragment retropulsion resulting in moderate spinal canal stenosis. Diffuse osseous metastatic disease. No definite lesions at imminent risk of additional fracture.  11/05/19: NM bone scan: Diffuse foci of uptake involving the calvarium, ribs, spine, pelvis, and femurs c/w osseous metastatic disease.  11/07/19: Axillary LN biopsy: Metastatic carcinoma, ER+ (71-80%), PR- (<1%), *****- (IHC 2+, FISH 3.June 04.9=1.3)  ***** testing from ***** biopsy from November 2019: *****+, ***** mutation  11/07/19: Started zolendronic acid. 4 mg monthly x 3 then every 3 months  *****/*****-*****/*****/*****: Radiation C1-3, T12-L2, 5 fractures ***** total  11/21/19: MRI brain: Demyelinating disease in the supratentorial and infratentorial brain, without active disease  12/03/19-early July 2020: Letrozole and Palbociclib 125mg daily ***** d, 7 d off. Stopped in early July due to *****  12/17/19: MRI total spine: Multifocal enhancing marrow replacement in the clivus, vertebral bodies and posterior elements, bilateral sacral ala and iliac bones, likely from diffuse osseous metastatic disease. Unchanged compression fracture of C2, expanding the anterior and posterior cortices, with mild spinal canal narrowing. Compression fractures involving the superior endplates of L1 and L3, with approximately 25% loss of height, again noted, with increased enhancing STIR hyperintensity in T12 through L2, likely from with suspected evolving compression fracture of L2, without significant retropulsion at this time.  03/11/20: CT CAP: Enlarged right axillary and mediastinal lymphadenopathy suspicious for metastatic disease although, the lymph nodes appear to be slightly decreased in size from the prior exam. Diffuse osseous metastatic disease unchanged from the prior exam  07/01/20: CT CAP: Pathologic right axillary mediastinal 
 lymphadenopathy, worrisome for nodal metastatic disease, stable since 03/10/2020. Multiple hypoattenuating lesions scattered throughout the right and left hepatic lobes, worrisome for metastatic disease, increased in size and in number compared to 03/10/2020. Extensive blastic osseous metastatic disease involving the visualized portions of the axial/appendicular ***** with lower lumbar spine, left inferior pubic ramus, probable left acetabular, sternal, and multiple rib pathologic fracture deformities, unchanged since 03/10/2020. Small left pleural effusion with associated compressive atelectasis and/or consolidation.  08/06/20: Screening mammogram: Negative  Early August 2020: Started on capecitabine one week one, one week off. Patient accidentally took only 500mg BID until mid-September. Increased to 1000mg BID in mid-September, then 1500mg BID in late September  Late August 2020: Patient developed increased thirst, lightheadedness, visual disturbances  08/29/20: NCHCT negative acute  09/29/20: MRI brain: Stable demyelinating diseases. *****, somewhat nodular ***** enhancement along the bilateral cerebral convexities and right petroclival region, covering the right porus acusticus and filling the right *****'s *****. Differential diagnostic considerations include dural metastases versus infectious/inflammatory processes.  10/10/20: LP. CSF 0 WBC, glucose 57, protein 72 (chronically elevated), cytology negative  10/22/20: ***** onc visit (Dr. ***** *****): "visual disturbance with CN VI paralysis stable and clinical picture not consistent with what we usually would expect from leptomeningeal spread of breast cancer. ***** to continue xeloda for now and monitor with follow up visit in 3-4 weeks and then repeat MRI brain in late November."  11/07/20: ED presentation for dizziness. NCHCT: ***** thickening bilaterally demonstrating a somewhat nodular appearance concerning for dural metastases, more prominent than prior CT. No mass 
 effect or midline shift. Diffuse osseous metastases throughout the calvarium. Stable findings of demyelinating disease.  11/07/20: MRI brain: Stable demyelinating disease since 09/29/2020. No active lesions. Stable diffuse osseous metastases. Diffuse irregular ***** enhancement along the bilateral cerebral convexities and right petroclival region, and nodular enhancement filling the right *****'s ***** is again seen and unchanged compared to 09/29/2020. This is presumed to represent metastatic disease. Since that study, there is increased involvement of the right internal auditory canal       *****, ***** reports that starting in late August, she developed decreased vision in her right eye. She reports double vision with gaze in certain positions. 3-4 weeks ago she also lost hearing in her right ear. Most recently, she developed dizziness, prompting an ED visit on 11/07/20. MRI brain showed that compared to an MRI brain from 09/29/20, there was largely unchanged ***** enhancement along the bilateral cerebral convexities and right petroclival region. The report did describe possible increase thickening in the right internal auditory canal.     She also has a history of MS, which was initially diagnosed in 1985. ***** reports that her MS presented with optic neuritis and loss of vision in her right eye. The optic neuritis resolved and her right eye vision has improved since that time. She has been wheelchair-bound since 2002 or 2003. She has been on Avonex (interferon beta 1a) for many years and she reports that her MS has been largely stable.    ROS: Vision and hearing changes per HPI.

We had a lengthy discussion with the patient and her daughter which we reviewed her breast cancer diagnosis, workup and treatment history to date. I reviewed all of the relevant and available clinic notes, imaging, and pathology reports. First, we reviewed *****'s pathology confirming that she has metastatic breast cancer which is estrogen receptor positive 
 and ***** negative based on core needle biopsy of an axillary LN in November 2019. She presented with extensive lytic bone lesions at that time. She has since developed metastatic disease to the liver and pachymeninges and possibly to the leptomeninges, although her first CSF cytology was negative for malignant cells. We explained that metastatic breast cancer is not curable, but it is treatable and there are therapies that will extend the quality and duration of life.     We reviewed her treatment course to date. She was initially started on letrozole/palbociclib in December 2019, but this was discontinued due to PD to the liver and LN in July 2020. WE assured ***** that this was an appropriate treatment choice as initial therapy of *****+/*****- metastatic disease. Upon progression, she was switched to Xeloda (initially 500mg BID inadvertantly, then 1000mg BID in mid-September, and 1500 mg BID since late September).     She recently had brain MRIs on 09/29/20 and again on 11/07/20, which showed diffuse irregular ***** enhancement along the bilateral cerebral convexities and right petroclival region as well as *****'s ***** The more recent scan showed possibly worsening of disease in the internal auditory canal, which would be consistent with her recent right hearing loss.  We tried to explain to the patient and family the difference between ***** based/***** disease and leptomeningeal disease and stressed that it can be very difficulty radiographically to distinguish the two. While her first CSF cytology was negative for malignant cells, her radiographic and clinical findings raise suspicion for leptomeningeal disease.    Recently, her neurologic symptoms are getting progressively worse, with no improvement in her vision and now auditory symptoms. Despite her initial CSF cytology being negative, we explained that  false negatives are not uncommon and we recommend repeat LP with cytology now. We also recommend referral to 
 radiation oncology for consideration of radiation therapy (either just to her internal auditory canal or to a larger portion of her *****). We would also consider starting low dose steroids to see if this improves her symptoms.     In terms of future options, if a CT CAP shows clear progression on Xeloda, we would consider another hormone-based therapy strategy. We would consider fulvestrant plus the ***** inhibitor ***** (*****) (***** ***** 2019), given her known ***** mutation on Strata testing. In this study, in the cohort of patients with *****-mutated cancer, progression-free survival at a median follow-up of 20 months was 11.0 months in the *****-fulvestrant group, as compared with 5.7 months in the placebo-fulvestrant group. However, this regimen does not have great CNS penetration, but there are few regimens that do.    Given that she has metastatic disease to the bone, we agree with continuing zolendronic acid    Recommendations:  -- Repeat CT CAP now  -- Repeat LP for CSF cytology  -- Repeat MRI spine to r/o LMD in the spine  -- Recommend referral to radiation oncology to consider either focal CNS radiation or possible even *****. The patient is interested in a UCSF Rad Onc opinion as well.  -- Could consider starting low dose steroids to see if reduction of swelling improves any of her symptoms  -- Continue xeloda 1500mg BID for now  -- At time of progression of disease, could consider fulvestrant + ***** given the ***** mutation on STRATA testing  -- Continue zolendronic acid    Patient seen and discussed with breast oncology attending *****. ***** *****.    ***** *****, MD PGY-5  Hematology/Oncology Fellow

Upon progression, she was switched to Xeloda (initially 500mg BID inadvertantly, then 1000mg BID in mid-September, and 1500 mg BID since late September). \nShe recently had brain MRIs on 09/29/20 and again on 11/07/20, which showed diffuse irregular enhancement along the bilateral cerebral convexities and right petroclival region as well as *****'s ***** The more recent scan showed possibly worsening of disease in the internal auditory canal, which would be consistent with her recent right hearing loss.  We tried to explain to the patient and family the difference between ***** based/HER2 disease and leptomeningeal disease and stressed that it can be very difficulty radiographically to distinguish the two. While her first CSF cytology was negative for malignant cells, her radiographic and clinical findings raise suspicion for leptomeningeal disease. \nRecently, her neurologic symptoms are getting progressively worse, with no improvement in her vision and now auditory symptoms. Despite her initial CSF cytology being negative, we explained that  false negatives are not uncommon and we recommend repeat LP with cytology now. We also recommend referral to radiation oncology for consideration of radiation therapy (either just to her internal auditory canal or to a larger portion of her *****). We would also consider starting low dose steroids to see if this improves her symptoms. \nIn terms of future options, if a CT CAP shows clear progression on Xeloda, we would consider another hormone-based therapy strategy. We would consider fulvestrant plus the HER2 inhibitor palbociclib (PALOBER 2019), given her known HER2 mutation on Strata testing. In this study, in the cohort of patients with HER2-mutated cancer, progression-free survival at a median follow-up of 20 months was 11.0 months in the palbociclib-fulvestrant group, as compared with 5.7 months in the placebo-fulvestrant group. However, this regimen does not have great CNS penetration, but there are few regimens that do. \nGiven that she has metastatic disease to the bone, we agree with continuing zolendronic acid \nRecommendations: \n-- Repeat CT CAP now \n-- Repeat LP for CSF cytology \n-- Repeat MRI spine to r/o LMD in the spine \n-- Recommend referral to radiation oncology to consider either focal CNS radiation or possible even *****. The patient is interested in a UCSF Rad Onc opinion as well. \n-- Could consider starting low dose steroids to see if reduction of swelling improves any of her symptoms \n-- Continue xeloda 1500mg BID for now \n-- At time of progression of disease, could consider fulvestrant + palbociclib given the HER2 mutation on STRATA testing \n-- Continue zolendronic acid \nPatient seen and discussed with breast oncology attending *****. ***** *****. \n***** *****, MD PGY-5 Hematology/Oncology Fellow \n\nAssessment and Plan: \nWe had a lengthy discussion with the patient and her daughter which we reviewed her breast cancer diagnosis, workup and treatment history to date. I reviewed all of the relevant and available clinic notes, imaging, and pathology reports. First, we reviewed *****'s pathology confirming that she has metastatic breast cancer which is estrogen receptor positive and HER2 negative based on core needle biopsy of an axillary LN in November 2019. She presented with extensive lytic bone lesions at that time. She has since developed metastatic disease to the liver and pachymeninges and possibly to the leptomeninges, although her first CSF cytology was negative for malignant cells. We explained that metastatic breast cancer is not curable, but it is treatable and there are therapies that will extend the quality and duration of life. \nWe reviewed her treatment course to date. She was initially started on letrozole/palbociclib in December 2019, but this was discontinued due to PD to the liver and LN in July 2020. WE assured ***** that this was an appropriate treatment choice as initial therapy of HER2+/ER- metastatic disease.
