Compression fractures involving the superior endplates of L1 and L3, with approximately 25% loss of height, again noted, with increased enhancing STIR hyperintensity in T12 through L2, likely from with suspected evolving compression fracture of L2, without significant retropulsion at this time.  03/11/20: CT CAP: Enlarged right axillary and mediastinal lymphadenopathy suspicious for metastatic disease although, the lymph nodes appear to be slightly decreased in size from the prior exam.

Diffuse irregular ***** enhancement along the bilateral cerebral convexities and right petroclival region, and nodular enhancement filling the right *****\\'s ***** is again seen and unchanged compared to 09/29/2020.

Since that study, there is increased involvement of the right internal auditory canal       *****, ***** reports that starting in late August, she developed decreased vision in her right eye. She reports double vision with gaze in certain positions. 3-4 weeks ago she also lost hearing in her right ear. Most recently, she developed dizziness, prompting an ED visit on 11/07/20. MRI brain showed that compared to an MRI brain from 09/29/20, there was largely unchanged ***** enhancement along the bilateral cerebral convexities and right petroclival region. The report did describe possible increase thickening in the right internal auditory canal.     She also has a history of MS, which was initially diagnosed in 1985. ***** reports that her MS presented with optic neuritis and loss of vision in her right eye. The optic neuritis resolved and her right eye vision has improved since that time. She has been wheelchair-bound since 2002 or 2003.

We had a lengthy discussion with the patient and her daughter which we reviewed her breast cancer diagnosis, workup and treatment history to date. I reviewed all of the relevant and available clinic notes, imaging, and pathology reports. First, we reviewed *****\\'s pathology confirming that she has metastatic breast cancer which is estrogen receptor positive \\n and ***** negative based on core needle biopsy of an axillary LN in November 2019. She presented with extensive lytic bone lesions at that time. She has since developed metastatic disease to the liver and pachymeninges and possibly to the leptomeninges, although her first CSF cytology was negative for malignant cells. We explained that metastatic breast cancer is not curable, but it is treatable and there are therapies that will extend the quality and duration of life.     We reviewed her treatment course to date. She was initially started on letrozole/palbociclib in December 2019, but this was discontinued due to PD to the liver and LN in July 2020. WE assured ***** that this was an appropriate treatment choice as initial therapy of *****+/*****- metastatic disease. Upon progression, she was switched to Xeloda (initially 500mg BID inadvertantly, then 1000mg BID in mid-September, and 1500 mg BID since late September).     She recently had brain MRIs on 09/29/20 and again on 11/07/20, which showed diffuse irregular ***** enhancement along the bilateral cerebral convexities and right petroclival region as well as *****\\'s ***** The more recent scan showed possibly worsening of disease in the internal auditory canal, which would be consistent with her recent right hearing loss.  We tried to explain to the patient and family the difference between ***** based/***** disease and leptomeningeal disease and stressed that it can be very difficulty radiographically to distinguish the two. While her first CSF cytology was negative for malignant cells, her radiographic and clinical findings raise suspicion for leptomeningeal disease.    Recently, her neurologic symptoms are getting progressively worse, with no improvement in her vision and now auditory symptoms. Despite her initial CSF cytology being negative, we explained that  false negatives are not uncommon and we recommend repeat LP with cytology now. We also recommend referral to \\n radiation oncology for consideration of radiation therapy (either just to her internal auditory canal or to a larger portion of her *****). We would also consider starting low dose steroids to see if this improves her symptoms.     In terms of future options, if a CT CAP shows clear progression on Xeloda, we would consider another hormone-based therapy strategy. We would consider fulvestrant plus the ***** inhibitor ***** (*****) (***** ***** 2019), given her known ***** mutation on Strata testing. In this study, in the cohort of patients with *****-mutated cancer, progression-free survival at a median follow-up of 20 months was 11.0 months in the *****-fulvestrant group, as compared with 5.7 months in the placebo-fulvestrant group. However, this regimen does not have great CNS penetration, but there are few regimens that do.    Given that she has metastatic disease to the bone, we agree with continuing zolendronic acid    Recommendations:  -- Repeat CT CAP now  -- Repeat LP for CSF cytology  -- Repeat MRI spine to r/o LMD in the spine  -- Recommend referral to radiation oncology to consider either focal CNS radiation or possible even *****. The patient is interested in a UCSF Rad Onc opinion as well.  -- Could consider starting low dose steroids to see if reduction of swelling improves any of her symptoms  -- Continue xeloda 1500mg BID for now  -- At time of progression of disease, could consider fulvestrant + ***** given the ***** mutation on STRATA testing  -- Continue zolendronic acid    Patient seen and discussed with breast oncology attending *****. ***** *****.    ***** *****, MD PGY-5  Hematology/Oncology Fellow    \\n'"

    "* **History of Present Illness (HPI):** This is the detailed story of the Chief Complaint. It explains the symptoms using a framework often remembered by the acronym \"OLDCARTS\":\n",
    "    * **O**nset: When did the problem begin?\n",
    "    * **L**ocation: Where is the symptom located?\n",
    "    * **D**uration: How long has it been going on?\n",
    "    * **C**haracterization: What does the symptom feel like (e.g., sharp, dull)?\n",

    "    * **R**adiation: Does the sensation move anywhere else?\n",
    "    * **T**emporal factor: Is it worse at a certain time of day?\n",
    "    * **S**everity: How bad is it on a scale of 1 to 10?\n",
    "* **History:** This section provides background context, including Oncology History (past cancer diagnoses/treatments), Past Medical History, Surgical History, Family History, and Social History.\n",
    "* **Assessment and Plan (A&P):** This is the doctor’s summary and conclusion. The Assessment is the diagnosis, and the Plan outlines the next steps (tests, treatments, etc.).\n",

    "**1. Letter Structure and Flow:** Organize your letter logically using the following question-based headers to guide the reader.\n",
    "    * **Empathetic Opening:** Start with a short, warm, and supportive salutation. (e.g., \"Dear [Patient Name],\") Acknowledge the reason for their recent visit.\n",
    "    * **Why did you come to the clinic?**\n",
    "        * Answer this using information from the **Chief Complaint (CC)** section. State the main symptom or reason for the visit clearly and simply.\n",

    "        * Also, briefly recap relevant information from the **History** section (e.g., \"As a reminder, your initial diagnosis was...\").\n",
    "        * **Crucial rule:** When discussing past treatment decisions, use neutral language. Instead of \"you refused,\" say \"At that time, the decision was made not to proceed with...\"\n",
    "    * **What did we find? (Assessment)**\n",
    "        * Clearly and gently explain the main conclusion from the **Assessment** part of the note. Explain what terms like \"metastatic\" or \"recurrence\" mean. Use an analogy if helpful.\n",
    "        * **STRICT NEGATIVE CONSTRAINT:** If the cancer has spread (metastasis), absolutely DO NOT list the specific organs affected. Instead, just say \"the cancer has spread to other parts of your body.\"\n",
    "    * **What is the plan? (Plan)**\n",
    "        * Detail the next steps from the **Plan** section. For each step (biopsy, MRI, new medication), explain **WHAT** it is and, more importantly, **WHY** we are doing it.\n",
    "        * If the note mentions palliative care, explain it as an active treatment focused on controlling cancer, managing symptoms, and maximizing quality of life. The focus must be on living well.\n",
    "    * **Closing with Support:** End the letter by reinforcing that your team is there to support them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Language and Tone Directives:**\n",
    "    * **Maintain Your Persona:** Use \"we\" for the medical team. Write with empathy and clarity.\n",
    "    * **STRICT NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS:**\n",
    "        * Do not use fatalistic language. Avoid phrases like \"until the end of your life\" or \"preparing for the end.\" The focus MUST be on quality and extension of LIFE.\n",
