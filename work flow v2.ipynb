      "I want to explain what happened to you during your stay here at [Hospital1 18]. You were an 81-year-old woman who had been struggling with a lung condition called emphysema, which is a problem with the air sacs in your lungs. You weren't using oxygen at home before this visit, but recently you had a flare-up of your emphysema and needed oxygen to help you breathe.\n",
      "\n",
      "When you arrived at our emergency room, your oxygen levels were low even with the help of a CPAP machine. We tried various treatments, including steroids, nebulizers, and medication, but nothing seemed to help. That's why we decided to admit you to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and later to [Doctor Last Name ]'s care.\n",
      "\n",
      "While in the ICU, we discovered that your airways were narrowing, which made it difficult for you to breathe properly. To help with this issue, we placed two silicone stents – small tubes – in your airways. One went into your left main stem bronchus and the other went into your trachea (windpipe). This procedure was done under general anesthesia, which means you were asleep during the operation.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the stent placement, we were able to gradually wean you off the ventilator and eventually extubate you (remove the breathing tube). You spent some time on a cool mist shovel mask and your oxygen levels improved. Once your oxygen levels were stable, we moved you to a regular hospital room and began weaning you off the steroids.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also addressed some other issues during your stay. Your blood pressure was a bit high, so we adjusted your medications to bring it under control. You had some episodes of chest pain, but tests showed that it wasn't related to a heart attack. We gave you medication to help with the pain and continue your previous medications for angina (chest pain due to poor blood flow to the heart).\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, we noticed that you had some muscle weakness, possibly due to steroid myopathy (muscle weakness caused by steroid use) and deconditioning (loss of muscle strength due to prolonged bed rest). We referred you to physical therapy to help strengthen your muscles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, your stay with us was challenging, but we're pleased to say that you're on the road to recovery! After being stabilized, we discharged you to [Hospital1] for further rehabilitation. We recommend that you follow up with [Doctor First Name4 Last Name] within two weeks, as well as with the Interventional Pulmonology service for a follow-up appointment regarding your stents. If your muscle weakness doesn't improve within a week, we suggest seeing a neurologist.\n",
      "\n",
      "Take care and keep fighting, [Patient's Name]! We believe in your ability to overcome this challenge and return to your normal routine soon.</s>\n",
