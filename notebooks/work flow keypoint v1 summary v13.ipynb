      "What you told us: You shared with us that you've been experiencing some pain and numbness in your hands and fingers, as well as some joint pain. You also mentioned that you're worried about the port site not healing as quickly as you'd like.\n",

      "What did we find: We reviewed your pathology report and found that the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. We also saw that you have some residual disease with positive margins, which means that the cancer is still present in the area where we removed it. We also found that you have 2/2 positive nodes with extranodal extension, which means that the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes.\n",

      "What is the plan: We're going to start you on a medication called letrozole to help slow down the growth of the cancer. We'll also continue to monitor your pain and numbness, and we may need to adjust your pain medication as needed. We'll also be referring you to a radiation oncologist to discuss radiation therapy as part of your treatment plan.\n",
