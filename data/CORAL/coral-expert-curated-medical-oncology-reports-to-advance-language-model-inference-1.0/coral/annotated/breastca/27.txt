  Chief complaint: Patient with breast cancer here to discuss adjuvant therapy    History of Present Illness:  ***** ***** is a 70 y.o. female with a h/o HTN, HLD, and a recent diagnosis of stage IIA pT2(m)N1a L breast IDC (3.9 cm, grade 2, ER+/PR+/HER- with FISH ratio 1.1, high-risk mammaprint) s/p 08/18/17 bilateral mastectomies with left axillary LND with 2/12 LN+, who presents to establish Oncology care.    Ms. *****'s history is notable for a screening mammogram performed 01/25/17, which was read as unremarkable with BI-RADS 1.  Several months later, she noticed a left breast mass.  She underwent another mammogram on 05/27/17 that showed several solid masses (solid mass in the left breast at 3 o'clock; a solid mass in the left breast at 1 o'clock; prominent lymph node in the left axilla).  Ultrasound performed at ***** showed a 11 x 12 x 12 mm irregular, heterogeneous hypoechoic solid mass in the outer central left breast at ~3 o'clock and a 15 x 12 x 14 mm irregular solid mass in the upper outer left breast at ~2 o'clock likely within the large area of multiple small masses seen at mammography, and at least two abnormal L axillary lymph nodules.  A 06/20/17 ultrasound-guided core biopsy of the L breast mass at  3 o'clock showed invasive ductal carcinoma, as well as ductal carcinoma in situ, intermediate nuclear grade, and microcalcification associated with ductal carcinoma in situ, with strong ER positive (100%), strong PR positive (>95%), and HER-2 negative (1+ IHC).She also underwent a FNA of a left axillary lymph node that revealed metastatic carcinoma of the breast.      She was evaluated by Dr. ***** of breast surgical oncology and the patient opted to pursue bilateral double mastectomies.  She was admitted from *****/*****/*****-*****/*****/***** for bilateral mastectomies, left axillary lymph node dissection, levels 1 and 2, and bilateral plastics closure.  Her pathology showed IDC multifocal, SBR grade 2 and 1, 
 largest focus 3.9 cm, margins negative; Ductal carcinoma in situ, intermediate nuclear grade, metastatic carcinoma to two lymph nodes (2/2), 1.5 cm largest deposit, microcalcifications in association with ductal carcinoma in situ and benign ducts.  She was last seen by Dr. ***** in clinic on 08/31/17 where her surgical sites were well-healed and her JP drains were removed. She presents today to establish medical oncology care.  She has an appointment with ***** ***** on 10/10/2017.    Has been feeling well since her surgery, has been healing well.  Has slight more arm stiffness on her left arm but it is improving.  Has some associated numbness near her left axilla and left elbow post-operatively.    Of note is that her paternal grandmother passed away from breast cancer in her 60s.  Sister had breast cancer s/p double mastectomy.   No ovarian or pancreatic cancer history.  Her father has ***** Jewish heritage.  She has not undergone Genetic testing previously.

Radiology:  06/20/17 Ultrasound, Left  Mammographic Findings:  There are scattered areas of fibroglandular density.    At the site of the palpable lump in the outer central left breast, middle depth, marked by BB  there is a 15 mm irregular obscured mass with associated architectural distortion.    No single mammographic correlate for site of palpable concern in the left breast marked by more anterior BB.  However, there are innumerable small masses centered in the outer central left breast with some extension into upper outer quadrant.  There is also associated nipple retraction.    Ultrasound Findings:  There is a 11 x 12 x 12 mm irregular, not-parallel, heterogeneous hypoechoic solid mass with angular margins, in the outer central left breast, at approximately 3 o'clock, 8 cm from nipple, corresponding to the mammographic mass with associated architectural distortion and one of the palpable lumps. Vascularity is present.    There is a 15 x 12 x 14 mm irregular solid mass with angular margins, in the upper outer left breast, at approximately 2 o'clock, 3 cm from nipple, which contains calcifications, likely within the large area of multiple small masses seen at mammography.    There are at least two abnormal left axillary lymph nodes at 2:00, 20cm from the nipple, with coritcal thickness measuring up to 9mm.    IMPRESSION:   Left breast: Highly suggestive of malignancy (BI-RADS 5).    Recommendations:  Recommend ultrasound-guided core biopsy of left breast mass, at 3:00, 8cm from the nipple as the more suspicious of the two ultrasound masses.    Recommend fine needle 
 aspiration of abnormal left axillary lymph node.      06/20/17 Mammogram, Left  Mammographic Findings:  There are scattered areas of fibroglandular density.

COMMENT:  For the left mastectomy specimen (part B), two lesions are 
 identified  grossly. The first lesion (designated as lesion #1 in the gross  description) is in the lower central breast, measures 3.0 cm and is  associated with a biopsy clip. This lesion shows a single continuous  invasive ductal carcinoma microscopically, spans slices 9 to 11 and  measures 3.0 cm (tumor #1 in the synoptic comment). The second lesion  (lesion #2) is superior to lesion #1 and appears multinodular grossly in  slices 7 to 11. Extensive and sequential sampling of lesion #1 shows  extensive DCIS with three separate foci of invasive carcinoma:  designated as tumors #2 to 4 as in the synoptic comment. Tumor #2 is in  slice 7 and tumor #3 in slices 9 to 11, separated by slice 8, which  shows DCIS without invasion (slides B7 and B26). Tumor #1 and tumor #3  are separated by 1.8 cm of DCIS as in slide B9. Tumor #4 is in ***** 9  and is 0.8 cm away from tumor #3 as in slide B10.

Lymph node, left axillary, ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration:  Positive for metastatic carcinoma; see comment.     COMMENTS:   The aspirates are abundantly cellular and reveal scattered irregular  sheets of malignant cells, some forming glandular structures. The cells  have enlarged nuclei with irregular nuclear contours and scant to  moderate cytoplasm. The cell block sample is concordant. The findings  are consistent with metastatic carcinoma of the breast. See also the  corresponding left breast core biopsy (*****-*****).       Assessment / Plan:   ***** ***** is a 70 y.o. female with a h/o HTN, HLD, and a 
 recent diagnosis of stage IIA pT2(m)N1a L breast IDC (3.9 cm, grade 2, ER+/PR+/HER- with FISH ratio 1.1, high-risk mammaprint) s/p 08/18/17 bilateral mastectomies with left axillary LND with 2/12 LN+, who presents to establish Oncology care.    She has stage IIA IDC with known lymph node involvement (2 out of 12 nodes), and she has completed bilateral mastectomies.  Given her early stage breast cancer with positive LN involvement, the mammaprint is essential in determining the next steps in her care.  Her Mammaprint resulting as high-risk, supporting that she would benefit from chemotherapy in addition to the use of an aromatase inhibitor.  Today we discussed in detail the options for the next steps in chemotherapy, and our recommendation to pursue treatment with AC with paclitaxel.  We discussed the potential side effects of chemotherapy, including fatigue, n/v, and hair loss, among others.  She is in agreement to pursue treatment, which we recommend starting about 2 months post-operatively (so estimated 10/18/2017).  Prior to chemotherapy she will need a baseline TTE given the potential cardiotoxic side effects of an anthracycline, IV access (she prefers a PAC), and chemotherapy teaching.    Of note is her strong family history of breast cancer along her paternal side, which is also of ***** Jewish heritage making her a potentially BRCA positive.  She is in agreement to pursue genetic counseling, and we referred her for genetic testing.    Plan:  - patient agreed to start chemotherapy with AC + paclitaxel, estimated start date 10/18/2017  - ordered for pre-chemotherapy TTE  - requested pre-chemotherapy teaching  - port placement ordered  - referral placed to Genetics    All of the patients questions and concerns were answered to her satisfaction.  This patient was evaluated and discussed with attending, Dr. *****.    ***** *****, MD  Hematology/Oncology Fellow  09/19/17
