    "* **History of Present Illness (HPI):** This is the detailed story of the Chief Complaint. It explains the symptoms using a framework often remembered by the acronym \"OLDCARTS\":\n",

    "    * **L**ocation: Where is the symptom located?\n",

    "    * **R**adiation: Does the sensation move anywhere else?\n",

    "    * **S**everity: How bad is it on a scale of 1 to 10?\n",
    "* **History:** This section provides background context, including Oncology History (past cancer diagnoses/treatments), Past Medical History, Surgical History, Family History, and Social History.\n",
    "* **Assessment and Plan (A&P):** This is the doctor’s summary and conclusion. The Assessment is the diagnosis, and the Plan outlines the next steps (tests, treatments, etc.).\n",

    "    * **Empathetic Opening:** Start with a short, warm, and supportive salutation. (e.g., \"Dear [Patient Name],\") Acknowledge the reason for their recent visit.\n",
    "    * **Why did you come to the clinic?**\n",
    "        * Answer this using information from the **Chief Complaint (CC)** section. State the main symptom or reason for the visit clearly and simply.\n",
    "    * **What was discussed?**\n",

    "        * Also, briefly recap relevant information from the **History** section (e.g., \"As a reminder, your initial diagnosis was...\").\n",

    "    * **What did we find? (Assessment)**\n",
    "        * Clearly and gently explain the main conclusion from the **Assessment** part of the note. Explain what terms like \"metastatic\" or \"recurrence\" mean. Use an analogy if helpful.\n",
    "        * **STRICT NEGATIVE CONSTRAINT:** If the cancer has spread (metastasis), absolutely DO NOT list the specific organs affected. Instead, just say \"the cancer has spread to other parts of your body.\"\n",
    "    * **What is the plan? (Plan)**\n",
    "        * Detail the next steps from the **Plan** section. For each step (biopsy, MRI, new medication), explain **WHAT** it is and, more importantly, **WHY** we are doing it.\n",
    "        * If the note mentions palliative care, explain it as an active treatment focused on controlling cancer, managing symptoms, and maximizing quality of life. The focus must be on living well.\n",
    "    * **Closing with Support:** End the letter by reinforcing that your team is there to support them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Language and Tone Directives:**\n",
    "    * **Maintain Your Persona:** Use \"we\" for the medical team. Write with empathy and clarity.\n",
    "    * **STRICT NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS:**\n",
    "        * Do not use fatalistic language. Avoid phrases like \"until the end of your life\" or \"preparing for the end.\" The focus MUST be on quality and extension of LIFE.\n",
