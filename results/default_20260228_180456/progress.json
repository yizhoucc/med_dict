Malignant neoplasm of overlapping sites of right breast in female, estrogen receptor positive (CMS code)  NM Whole Body Bone Scan    MR Brain with and without Contrast    Complete Blood Count with Differential    Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (BMP, AST, ALT, T.BILI, ALKP, TP, ALB)    Cancer Antigen 15-3    Carcinoembryonic Antigen    Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time    Prothrombin Time    Ambulatory Referral to Integrative Medicine       History of Present Illness:   56 year old female diagnosed in May 2013 with a multifocal Stage IIA right breast cancer.  She had a mastectomy with sentinel node and implant reconstruction in June 2013 and had  2.3 and 2.4 cm tumors found with a negative sentinel node.  The tumors were G2,  ER and PR positive and her 2 neu negative.  She did not have radiation or chemotherapy and declined tamoxifen.  She has had ***** but no other imaging since her diagnosis for screening and was treated at *****.     She reports feeling discomfort and pressure in her waist and back for a few months and nausea and burping for a week.  She went to the ER and had a CT scan which shows widely metastatic cancer.  She has involvement of the lungs, peritoneum, liver and ovary with a local recurrence near the right axilla and implant.  She takes a long list of supplements which she will send to me.  She wants to have natural therapies.  She is very scared and appears anxious.  Her husband is here and very supportive.  We discussed how we need to get a biopsy to evaluate the phenotype of the cancer and she is agreeable.  I will set her up to see Dr. \n ***** this week for a biopsy of the right axilla in the office.  We discussed how treatment would be palliative but that treatment could improve her quality of life as well as length of life.  She asked me multiple times if this can be cured.       I will refer her to the ***** center.  I also ordered a MRI of brain and bone scan as well as labs to complete her work up.

Widespread metastases consistent with metastatic \n breast  carcinoma.    2. Right axillary adenopathy with 1.8 cm spiculated mass along  superolateral margin of right breast implant, suspicious for  regional recurrence.    3. Multiple small pulmonary nodules, right greater than left,  likely metastatic.    4. Large anterior right and left lobe hepatic masses likely  metastatic.    5. Peritoneal carcinomatosis with omental *****, nodularity, and  small possibly malignant effusion.    6. Mildly enlarged and hyperdense ovaries which could reflect  breast metastases to ovaries.    7. Appendix distended with fluid without associated inflammatory  wall thickening. A mucocele of the appendix would be a  consideration.    8. No CT evidence of osseous metastasis.

No further adjuvant therapy given and patient declined tamoxifen.   2.  Metastatic relapse of her breast cancer.  She needs tissue confirmation and we will complete her staging work up.    3.  Appointment with Dr. ***** on Thursday to biopsy mass in right axilla in the office.   4.  RTC with me after completed work up to formulate a plan.
