Multiple bilateral pulmonary parenchymal nodules are present. Left lower lobe nodule measures up to 8 mm and multiple additional nodules are identified, many \n nodules or pleural-based. There are areas of subsegmental atelectasis in both lungs. There are no pleural effusions. Mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy identified. Mediastinal lymph nodes measure up to 15 mm. Largest hilar lymph nodes are present with a left hilar lymph node measuring up to 15 mm. There are multiple enlarged cardiophrenic angle lymph nodes. There are enlarged internal mammary lymph nodes on the right. There is extensive right axillary lymphadenopathy. Nodes measure up to 21 x 18 mm. Multiple nodules are present in the upper inner right breast, one of which is inseparable from the underlying pectoral muscles. There is skin thickening over the central breast and there is an irregularly marginated mass within the breast centrally located above the nipple measuring over 6 cm. There are multiple small lymph nodes in the upper abdomen. Portacaval lymph node measures up to 30 x 15 mm. Small  para-aortic lymph nodes are also present less than 1 cm. There is widespread osseous metastatic disease. Pathologic destruction of multiple ribs and extensive distraction of the sternum involving body of the sternum as well as the manubrium. There is involvement of the thoracic spine most severe at T10 where there is involvement of the vertebral body the pedicle and there is intraspinal extension along the right and lateral aspects of the canal. There is involvement of the right pedicle L1 as well.  02/10/18 MRI Lumbar spine w/ and w/o contrast: Abnormal marrow signal with replacement of normal marrow throughout the lumbosacral spine consistent with metastatic infiltration. Sacral tissues are also infiltrated. There is mild fracture of the inferior endplate of L1 on the right side. T12 inferior endplate demonstrates fracture mild loss of height as well. Epidural contrast enhancement ventrally and dorsally consistent with metastases. This is ***** at L5 level. Abnormal replacement of the marrow signal with tumor \n enhancement along the sacral foramina and sacral canal. T12-L1: Areas mild epidural tumor at T12 compressing the thecal sac ventrally. L1-L2: Mild facet hypertrophy and mild central stenosis. L2-L3: Mild dural thickening and facet hypertrophy. L3-L4: Is asymmetrical epidural fat compressing the thecal sac with moderate stenosis. It is mild dural enhancement. There is mild tumor enhancement posterior to the psoas muscle on the right side at L4. Measures approximately 12 mm. L4-L5: Disc bulge and right sided small disc herniation resulting in right lateral recess and neural foraminal stenosis. Mild dural contrast enhancement. L5-S1: There is no central skull tumor. There is epidural thickening. This is extending from S1 segment.  02/10/17 MRI Thoracic spine w/ and w/o contrast: Thoracic metastases throughout the spine. Minimal compression of T6. There is spinal CORD compression due to epidural tumor and thickening from approximately T5-T9. There is separate mild epidural tumor and thecal sac and cord deformity at T12. The epidural enhancement is contiguous throughout the thoracic spine.  02/10/17 MRI Cervical spine w/ and w/o contrast: Heterogeneous marrow signal throughout the cervical spine consistent with metastatic replacement. No epidural tumor. No intraspinal meningeal contrast enhancement. C5-C6: Mild bulge with mild central stenosis.  02/10/17 Bone scan: Multiple focal areas of increased activity are visualized in the skull, cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine, multiple ribs bilaterally sternum, pelvis, proximal humeri, hips and femurs. Findings correlates with lesions seen on MRI and are consistent with widespread metastatic involvement.Of incidental note, there is no evidence of mass abnormality of the kidneys or obstructive uropathy.   02/10/17 MRI Brain: Small dural based metastases are present along the posterior interhemispheric falx and right parietal convexity. These measure approximately 1 cm or less. \n There is no edema in the adjacent brain parenchyma. Ureteral based metastases are present along the posterior interhemispheric falx and parasagittal convexity bilaterally. There is no edema in the adjacent brain parenchyma. Additionally, small punctate foci of contrast enhancement are noted in the right cerebellar hemisphere inferiorly and posteriorly. It is not clear whether these are small parenchymal metastases or meningeal tumor. There is an approximately 15 mm  metastases in the upper clivus (skull).   02/10/17: BRCA1/2 negative.  02/11/17 CT A/P w/ contrast: Right breast skin thickening is partially imaged. Minimal bibasilar atelectasis. Right lower lobe posterior medial soft tissue thickening along the pleural surface. Few small right cardiophrenic angle lymph nodes are more numerous than normally seen. Small retroperitoneal lymph nodes are predominantly under 1 cm. Extensive bony lytic destructive appearance to the left inferior pubic ramus with subacute/healing fractures suggested. Old right inferior pubic ramus fracture is also seen as well as lytic appearance of the left greater than right acetabulum. Small nondisplaced fracture of the left sacral ala likely pathologic with diffuse osseous metastatic involvement of the sacrum and iliac bones as well as throughout the lumbar vertebral bodies and in multiple ribs. Several healing left and right rib fractures are seen also likely pathologic. Mild degenerative disc disease L4-5.Several endplate compression fracture deformities, for example, inferior endplate compression of T12. Large lytic lesion destroys and replaces much of T10.  02/11/17 bilateral diagnostic mammogram and limited right breast US: The breast tissue is fatty with scattered fibroglandular elements. In the right breast at 12 o'clock middle third, there is a large spiculated mass containing numerous suspicious calcifications.There is diffuse overlying skin thickening as well. No suspicious findings \n are seen in the left breast on mammography. High-resolution ultrasound of the right breast: At 12 o'clock, 2 cm from the nipple, there is a hypoechoic heterogeneous irregularly shaped mass measuring at least 10 x 5 x 7 cm corresponding to mammographic findings and palpable mass.

We discussed that DCIS is a surgical disease. The primary treatment is definitive surgery which she has had. I encouraged to meet with radiation oncology to discuss adjuvant radiation and its benefit in reducing local/regional recurrence. I explained that DCIS can return 50% of the time as another insitu disease and 50% of the time as invasive disease, but technically it should not result in distant recurrence due to lack of invasion. We discussed the role of systemic therapy with tamoxifen. We reviewed the ***** B-24 study that did show a statistically significant reduction in recurrence risk with 5 years of *****, albeit the benefit was small and the side effects are not insignificant. In particular the reduction in invasive disease was 3% with tamoxifen, the remaining benefit in non-invasive disease.  No difference in distant recurrence or survival. We discussed the potential side effects including but not limited to hot flashes, vaginal discharge, headache/migraines, vaginal dryness, mood instability, sexual dysfunction, ovarian cysts, increase in fibroids, impact on uterus including ***** and abnormal vaginal bleeding, as well as small increase risk of endometrial cancer (0.5%) and thrombosis (1-2%). We discussed that she is unable to get pregnant on tamoxifen.     The patient will think about the risk/benefit. I reassured her that her prognosis is excellent. We discussed other lifestyle factors to consider including exercise, healthy BMI <30, reducing etoh.       1. The patient concerns were discussed in detail. Patient verbalizes understanding of these issues and agrees with the plan.   2. Reviewed treatment options, treatment side effects in detail.   3. \n I reviewed the patient's medical information and medical history.   4. I have reviewed the past medical, family, and social history sections including the medications and allergies listed in the above medical record.   5.
