She had a mastectomy with sentinel node and implant reconstruction in June 2013 and had  2.3 and 2.4 cm tumors found with a negative sentinel node.  The tumors were G2,  ER and PR positive and her 2 neu negative.  She did not have radiation or chemotherapy and declined tamoxifen.  She has had ***** but no other imaging since her diagnosis for screening and was treated at *****.     She reports feeling discomfort and pressure in her waist and back for a few months and nausea and burping for a week.  She went to the ER and had a CT scan which shows widely metastatic cancer.  She has involvement of the lungs, peritoneum, liver and ovary with a local recurrence near the right axilla and implant.  She takes a long list of supplements which she will send to me.  She wants to have natural therapies.  She is very scared and appears anxious.  Her husband is here and very supportive.  We discussed how we need to get a biopsy to evaluate the phenotype of the cancer and she is agreeable.  I will set her up to see Dr. \n ***** this week for a biopsy of the right axilla in the office.  We discussed how treatment would be palliative but that treatment could improve her quality of life as well as length of life.  She asked me multiple times if this can be cured.       I will refer her to the ***** center.  I also ordered a MRI of brain and bone scan as well as labs to complete her work up.

Multiple bilateral pulmonary parenchymal nodules are present. Left lower lobe nodule measures up to 8 mm and multiple additional nodules are identified, many \n nodules or pleural-based. There are areas of subsegmental atelectasis in both lungs. There are no pleural effusions. Mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy identified. Mediastinal lymph nodes measure up to 15 mm. Largest hilar lymph nodes are present with a left hilar lymph node measuring up to 15 mm. There are multiple enlarged cardiophrenic angle lymph nodes. There are enlarged internal mammary lymph nodes on the right. There is extensive right axillary lymphadenopathy. Nodes measure up to 21 x 18 mm. Multiple nodules are present in the upper inner right breast, one of which is inseparable from the underlying pectoral muscles. There is skin thickening over the central breast and there is an irregularly marginated mass within the breast centrally located above the nipple measuring over 6 cm. There are multiple small lymph nodes in the upper abdomen. Portacaval lymph node measures up to 30 x 15 mm. Small  para-aortic lymph nodes are also present less than 1 cm. There is widespread osseous metastatic disease. Pathologic destruction of multiple ribs and extensive distraction of the sternum involving body of the sternum as well as the manubrium. There is involvement of the thoracic spine most severe at T10 where there is involvement of the vertebral body the pedicle and there is intraspinal extension along the right and lateral aspects of the canal. There is involvement of the right pedicle L1 as well.  02/10/18 MRI Lumbar spine w/ and w/o contrast: Abnormal marrow signal with replacement of normal marrow throughout the lumbosacral spine consistent with metastatic infiltration. Sacral tissues are also infiltrated. There is mild fracture of the inferior endplate of L1 on the right side. T12 inferior endplate demonstrates fracture mild loss of height as well. Epidural contrast enhancement ventrally and dorsally consistent with metastases. This is ***** at L5 level. Abnormal replacement of the marrow signal with tumor \n enhancement along the sacral foramina and sacral canal. T12-L1: Areas mild epidural tumor at T12 compressing the thecal sac ventrally. L1-L2: Mild facet hypertrophy and mild central stenosis. L2-L3: Mild dural thickening and facet hypertrophy. L3-L4: Is asymmetrical epidural fat compressing the thecal sac with moderate stenosis. It is mild dural enhancement. There is mild tumor enhancement posterior to the psoas muscle on the right side at L4. Measures approximately 12 mm. L4-L5: Disc bulge and right sided small disc herniation resulting in right lateral recess and neural foraminal stenosis. Mild dural contrast enhancement. L5-S1: There is no central skull tumor. There is epidural thickening. This is extending from S1 segment.  02/10/17 MRI Thoracic spine w/ and w/o contrast: Thoracic metastases throughout the spine. Minimal compression of T6. There is spinal CORD compression due to epidural tumor and thickening from approximately T5-T9. There is separate mild epidural tumor and thecal sac and cord deformity at T12. The epidural enhancement is contiguous throughout the thoracic spine.  02/10/17 MRI Cervical spine w/ and w/o contrast: Heterogeneous marrow signal throughout the cervical spine consistent with metastatic replacement. No epidural tumor. No intraspinal meningeal contrast enhancement. C5-C6: Mild bulge with mild central stenosis.  02/10/17 Bone scan: Multiple focal areas of increased activity are visualized in the skull, cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine, multiple ribs bilaterally sternum, pelvis, proximal humeri, hips and femurs. Findings correlates with lesions seen on MRI and are consistent with widespread metastatic involvement.Of incidental note, there is no evidence of mass abnormality of the kidneys or obstructive uropathy.   02/10/17 MRI Brain: Small dural based metastases are present along the posterior interhemispheric falx and right parietal convexity. These measure approximately 1 cm or less. \n There is no edema in the adjacent brain parenchyma. Ureteral based metastases are present along the posterior interhemispheric falx and parasagittal convexity bilaterally. There is no edema in the adjacent brain parenchyma. Additionally, small punctate foci of contrast enhancement are noted in the right cerebellar hemisphere inferiorly and posteriorly. It is not clear whether these are small parenchymal metastases or meningeal tumor. There is an approximately 15 mm  metastases in the upper clivus (skull).   02/10/17: BRCA1/2 negative.  02/11/17 CT A/P w/ contrast: Right breast skin thickening is partially imaged. Minimal bibasilar atelectasis. Right lower lobe posterior medial soft tissue thickening along the pleural surface. Few small right cardiophrenic angle lymph nodes are more numerous than normally seen. Small retroperitoneal lymph nodes are predominantly under 1 cm. Extensive bony lytic destructive appearance to the left inferior pubic ramus with subacute/healing fractures suggested. Old right inferior pubic ramus fracture is also seen as well as lytic appearance of the left greater than right acetabulum. Small nondisplaced fracture of the left sacral ala likely pathologic with diffuse osseous metastatic involvement of the sacrum and iliac bones as well as throughout the lumbar vertebral bodies and in multiple ribs. Several healing left and right rib fractures are seen also likely pathologic. Mild degenerative disc disease L4-5.Several endplate compression fracture deformities, for example, inferior endplate compression of T12. Large lytic lesion destroys and replaces much of T10.  02/11/17 bilateral diagnostic mammogram and limited right breast US: The breast tissue is fatty with scattered fibroglandular elements. In the right breast at 12 o'clock middle third, there is a large spiculated mass containing numerous suspicious calcifications.There is diffuse overlying skin thickening as well.

History of Present Illness  Her oncologic history is as summarized in the problem list.     Briefly, she had screen detected left breast cancer diagnosed on core biopsy in 2009. She underwent bilateral mastectomy with ***** and was found to have *****=/*****- 0.9cm grade II IDC with 0/2 LN involved with carcinoma and 1.8cm of DCIS. She took 5 years of tamoxifen and was only on letrozole for 6 months prior to discontinuation.     She was feeling well until April 2020 when she started to have low back pain and sought evaluation. She did not have imaging done, but her pain seem to resolve intermittently without any intervention. She then had severe diarrhea in December 2020 and had a CT of the abdomen obtain which showed colitis and incidentally noted a pulmonary nodule. A PET/CT was reportedly ordered to work this up further and revealed axillary hypermetabolic lymph nodes, multiple ***** and hilar FDG avid nodes, and innumerable osseous lesions throughout. A right ***** crest lesion was biopsied and found to be consistent with breast primary. It was also ER+ and ***** negative by FISH.     She is overall feeling well, but endorses having some left sided pain in the rib and mid axillary region. She otherwise ***** pain elsewhere. She has not had any cough, headaches, or neuro symptoms.       ONCOLOGIC HISTORY  Specialty Problems        Malignant Neoplasms    1.

We had an extensive discussion regarding her diagnosis and potential treatment options.     Given her cancer is HR+ and *****- we discussed that her treatment will include hormonal therapy. We discussed use of CDK February 26 inhibitors in combination with ***** for first line treatment. We reviewed the data from the ***** ***** which demonstrated ***** postmenopausal women with ER-positive, *****-negative breast cancer who were randomized to receive letrozole plus palbociclib had a median PFS of 24.8 months (compared with 14.5 months in the placebo). The most common adverse events were neutropenia, anemia, and fatigue. We also reviewed the anticipated side effects and risks associated with aromatase inhibitors including but not limited to arthralgias, urogenital atrophy, and possible acceleration of bone density loss/fractures, and discussed strategies to mitigate these side effects. She has consented to treatment and thus letrozole has been sent to ***** *****. Palbociclib has been sent to the ***** ***** *****. We discussed potential palbociclib side effects including but not limited to myelosuppression in particular neutropenia requiring count checks every 4 weeks before the start of the next cycle, as well as mucositis, fatigue, n/v, hair thinning, pneumonitis.      Since she has extensive bony mets and new pain, we recommend obtaining new scans and ordered MRI of total spine and CAP CT. We will request her outside PET/CT for comparison. We also discussed that in patients with breast cancer with bone metastases, use of bone modifying agents reduce the risk of skeletal related events. Thus, we recommend initiation of denosumab.We recommend that she have dental clearance prior to its initiation and reviewed potential AEs \n associated with this including *****. We also referred to radiation oncology for consult however her rib and back pain seem migratory and it is not clear if she has a focal site of pain.      We will request her outside pathology and request foundation one testing on this. If there are not enough cells, will send for ***** 360 testing.       Plan  - MRI Total Spine  - CT Chest, Abdomen, Pelvis  - Rad Onc referral  - Xgeva - needs dental evaluation first   - Obtain outside PET/CT  - Obtain outside path and send for foundation one, if this is not possible, would send for ***** 360  - Start Letrozole, Rx given  - Rx for Palbociclib.
