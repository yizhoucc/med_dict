She has had ***** but no other imaging since her diagnosis for screening and was treated at *****.     She reports feeling discomfort and pressure in her waist and back for a few months and nausea and burping for a week.  She went to the ER and had a CT scan which shows widely metastatic cancer.  She has involvement of the lungs, peritoneum, liver and ovary with a local recurrence near the right axilla and implant.  She takes a long list of supplements which she will send to me.  She wants to have natural therapies.  She is very scared and appears anxious.  Her husband is here and very supportive.  We discussed how we need to get a biopsy to evaluate the phenotype of the cancer and she is agreeable.  I will set her up to see Dr. \n ***** this week for a biopsy of the right axilla in the office.  We discussed how treatment would be palliative but that treatment could improve her quality of life as well as length of life.  She asked me multiple times if this can be cured.
