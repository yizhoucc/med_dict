She reports recovering well although is still experiencing tightness in the area.     Experiences night sweats for four days after injection. Otherwise manageable.     Patient Active Problem List    Diagnosis Date Noted   \u0007 Breast Cancer Right 04/25/2019     December 2018 self-palpated right breast mass  03/05/2019 Bilateral breast US (***** ***** Hospital in *****): 6x7 mm mass with ductal extension at 1 o'clock, likely DCIS.   03/17/2019 Gynecology at ***** for lower abdomen swelling, urethral discomfort and breast mass in the breast US (*****). On exam 1 cm firm, mobile, nontender mass approximately 5 cm from nipple at 1 o'clock.  03/17/2019: Right breast FNA at 1 o'clock (UCSF): Benign and could be seen in the setting of fibrocystic change or fibroadenoma.  03/17/2018 Abdomen-pelvic CT: No acute findings (for abdominal pain).  03/28/2019 Bilateral breast diagnostic mammogram (UCSF): A focal asymmetry is suggested in the region. Triangular marker denotes site of focal pain in the lower slightly outer right breast, with no underlying mammographic correlate. Scattered and occasionally grouped benign-appearing microcalcifications, both breasts, predominantly coarse dystrophic, likely the sequelae of reported fat grafting.  03/28/2019 Bilateral breast diagnostic US(UCSF): 22 x 10 x 15 mm oval complex solid and cystic mass with peripheral echogenicity and an irregular, antiparallel hypoechoic central component in the right upper inner quadrant, 1:00, 8 cm from nipple. The central hypoechoic component measures up to 10 mm. No sonographic correlate to site of focal pain in the lower outer right breast at 7 o'clock, 5 cm from nipple. No sonographic correlate to clinician's site of concern in the left axilla. A few normal-appearing nodes are identified. \n Left breast: benign  03/30/2019 Right breast US guided core biopsy at 1 o'clock 8 cm from nipple (UCSF): Grade 1 IDC, ER+(>95%), PR(~90% ranging from weak to strong nuclear staining), ***** equivocal(IHC 2), FISH non-amplified (0.55 cm largest dimension in a core; multiple core involved), *****-67: ~10%.

Left breast, mag seed-localized partial mastectomy:   1. Tumor bed with chronic inflammation.  2. Biopsy site changes.   3. Proliferative fibrocystic change with focal usual ductal hyperplasia  (*****) and sclerosing adenosis.  4. See comment.     B. Left breast, new margin, resection:   Benign breast tissue. See comment.    C. Left axillary lymph nodes, dissection:    1. Metastatic ductal carcinoma in three of twenty eight lymph nodes  (May 22).  2. Extracapsular extension.   3. Treatment effect.   4. Necrotizing lymphadenitis.  5. See comment.      D. Left axillary lymph node, level 3, dissection:   1. Necrotizing lymphadenitis.  2. Two of two lymph nodes with no tumor identified (0/2).   3. See comment.    COMMENT:  The partial mastectomy specimen (part A) was extensively sampled.  Sections reveal benign breast tissue with biopsy site changes and  treatment effect. To confirm the diagnosis, immunohistochemical stains  were performed on blocks A11 and A12 at ***** with the following results:  Stain     Target     Result  Keratin     Epithelial cells     Negative for invasive carcinoma (A11  and A12)  P63     Myoepithelium     Negative (A11)  SMM   \n    Myoepithelium     Negative (A11)    The immunohistochemical staining pattern supports the morphologic  findings and rules against an occult invasive carcinoma in part A.     The immunohistochemical staining pattern supports the morphologic  findings. Positive staining for ***** along with positive MPO in  histiocytes is compatible with ***** ***** lymphadenitis. Positive  staining for T cell markers without loss of specific markers, favors a  non-neoplastic process. The CD30 stain highlights ***** and  negative staining for CD15 rules against Hodgkin lymphoma. B cell  markers are negative, ruling against a B cell lymphoma. Negative  staining for keratin and CD68 and ***** rules against a histiocytic  process or fulminant treatment effect in the lymph node. Overall, the  findings support a diagnosis of necrotizing lymphadenitis. The  differential diagnosis includes ***** ***** disease, which is  favored, as well as lymphadenitis secondary to systemic lupus  erythematous. Serologic testing for lupus to rule out the diagnosis is  recommended.     ***** ***** is a self-limiting auto-immune disorder which presents  as acute or sub-acute lymphadenitis over the course of several weeks.  The differential diagnosis includes T cell lymphoma, which is largely  excluded in this case by IHC staining as well as lupus which can have  similar ***** (ref 1).
