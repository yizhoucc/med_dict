IMPORTANT classification rules:
- "bowel regimen" means laxatives, stool softeners, anti-diarrheals (e.g., docusate, miralax, lomotil, imodium). Antibiotics like doxycycline are NOT bowel regimen — classify them under "other treatment" or "infection management".
- "pain medication" means analgesics (opioids, NSAIDs, muscle relaxants for pain).
- "psychiatry medication" means antidepressants, anxiolytics, antipsychotics.
