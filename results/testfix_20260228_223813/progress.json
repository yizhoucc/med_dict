HPI  This postmenopausal ***** female is referred by breast surgeon Dr. ***** ***** following recent partial mastectomy for biopsy proven DCIS. She has ***** General Medicine history of care at ***** for osteopenia, dyslipidemia, impaired glucose tolerance, and also general health screening. Her recent mammographic screen (on 10/09/2018, compared with 05/10/2016 and earlier screens) identified an increase in suspicious, segmental, heterogeneously dense microcalcifications in her right upper outer breast; and imaged guided biopsy of these calcifications showed intermediate grade DCIS, ER+ (98%) PR+ (90%).  Her right breast 11/08/2018 stereotactic core biopsy showed intermediate grade DCIS associated with calcifications; and her ***** localized right upper quadrant partial mastectomy on 12/28/2017 showed intermediate nuclear grade DCIS, mixed solid papillary, cribiform pattern with some comedo necrosis, no invasive ductal cancer but DCIS spanning ~5.0 cm (9 contiguous slices), clear surgical margins. She has had an uncomplicated post-surgical course and was last seen by Dr. ***** on January 10 when she was referred to ***** ***** (today's visit) and also Rad Onc (scheduled for 02/01/2019) for consideration of adjuvant radiation +/- endocrine therapy to reduce her risk of right breast DCIS recurrence or progression to invasive cancer.    Medical, surgical, reproductive, family and social histories: menarche age 13, G0P0, menopause age 51, no history of hormone replacement therapy. She had benign right breast FNA in 2001 (*****, *****) and was evaluated for the UCSF ***** breast screening study in 2016 when she was estimated to have ***** 1.21% ***** 5 year risk of developing breast cancer (not elevated) and ***** ***** model 5 year risk of \n 2.97%. Due to her strong family history of breast cancer (two sisters in their 50s, plus multiple ***** in their 50s and ***** niece in her 40s with breast cancer) she had genetic testing (Invitae) on 09/20/2016 which evaluated 52 genes all of which were negative for any pathogenic variant sequences. She's had ***** recent bone density study 10/11/2018 (compared to 07/01/2014) showing continued osteopenia for which she's been on treatment with vitamin D and calcium supplementation; her bone density study will be repeated in 2 years. Apart from colonoscopy screening several years ago, she has never had any other surgical procedure. She is not on any prescription meds, including no drug treatments for her dyslipidemia or impaired glucose tolerance; and she has no known allergies. Her parents emigrated from ***** China when she was an infant and she has been ***** ***** ***** resident all her life. She is ***** never smoker and does not consume alcohol.

Psychiatric:         Mood and Affect: Mood and affect normal.       Assessment:       Nulliparous postmenopausal ***** female who, despite strong family history of breast cancer, negative genetic screen, and relatively low estimates of ever developing breast DCIS or breast cancer, showed progressing ~5cm area of suspicious ***** microcalcifications that, following complete resection, revealed intermediate grade ER+/PR+ DCIS spanning 5cm and including areas of comedo necrosis. I discussed with her Dr. *****'s recommendation that she be evaluated by Rad Onc and Med Onc to consider both adjuvant XRT and endocrine therapy to minimize \n her future risk of recurrent DCIS or progression to invasive ductal cancer over next decade, given her overall excellent health and likelihood of living another 20 years. I informed her that, overall, patients with DCIS may have up to 25-30% recurrence risk which could be reduced to 15% or less if given breast XRT; and that adjuvant endocrine therapy (e.g. aromatase inhibitor like Arimidex) for 5 years after XRT would further reduce her risk to 5-8% and provide lifelong chemoprotectant benefit for her uninvolved (left) breast. I emphasized that these options would not likely enhance her longevity.  I also pointed out that by the MSKCC nomogram for DCIS recurrence risk, inputting her age and all other features, her 10 year risk might be closer to 15%, but that XRT +/- endocrine therapy would provide significant risk reduction that she should consider further after her pending UCSF Rad Onc consultation. We also discussed the side effects and MSS and bone density complications of aromatase inhibitor therapy given her present diagnosis of osteopenia, and how this latter risk could be mitigated with bisphosphonate therapy.       Plan:       She is inclined toward undertaking additional adjuvant treatment(s) to minimize her risks over the next decade of recurrent DCIS or progression to invasive breast cancer. She understands and looks forward to her ***** evaluation in two weeks which requires her first decision. She will then plan to return for ***** follow-up visit in 3-4 months allowing time to complete right breast XRT if that option is recommended and accepted.         \n",

Assessment and Plan:  ***** ***** ***** is a 63 y.o. female with ***** +/ ***** negative invasive carcinoma with ductal and lobular features. We reviewed her work-up to date and her pathology result. I explained that her cancer is low risk and I do not recommend adjuvant chemotherapy. Because her breast cancer is strongly estrogen receptor positive, we discussed beginning an endocrine based therapy, specifically letrozole. She understands that she will receive at least five years of adjuvant hormonal therapy.     In terms of hormonal therapy, I explained that aromatase inhibitors have been shown to have improved outcomes in terms of DFS as compared to tamoxifen. I also discussed the data from ***** and ***** which demonstrated modest benefit of extending hormonal therapy beyond 5 years. I explained that the decision to continue the aromatase inhibitor beyond 5 years should be an individualized decision based on the patient's risk and tolerance of hormonal therapy.    I reviewed the anticipated side effects and risks associated with an \n aromatase inhibitors including arthralgias, urogenital atrophy, and possible acceleration of bone density loss. I explained that the joint pains are often the most difficult side effect to manage, and not infrequently, patients will switch to another aromatase inhibitor, and if not able to tolerate, we will consider switching to a different ***** or tamoxifen.    I have ordered a base line DEXA. We briefly discussed the role of bone targeted therapies. We will have a more in depth discussion of these therapies once she is further along in treatment. In the interim, I encouraged her to maintain a calcium rich diet, take in an adequate amount of Vitamin D (typically at least *****-***** ***** per day in a post-menopausal patient without much sun exposure) and engage in weight bearing exercise.  I  encouraged exercise to meet the goal of 150 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity per week since this has been associated with improvement in breast cancer specific and overall survival among breast cancer patients.

Currently on off week due to start 04/12/2011. Had constipation until last 4 days of cycle on xeloda. Denies hand and foot syndrome. Up and able to do more in the day. ***** on knitting project. In bed now 50% of the time. Denies going outside due to ***** hard to get up and down without assistance due to weakness. Denies dizziness or headache. Occasionally 1-2 times a month taking pain medication. Nausea and vomiting not a problem this cycle.Pain is happening in      Patient Active Problem List   Diagnoses Date Noted   \u0007 Breast cancer metastasized to multiple sites 01/28/2011     Priority: High     December 2006 patient had a mammogram and ultrasound of the right breast to evaluate a palpable mass.  In January 2007 patient underwent fine-needle aspiration that revealed invasive ductal carcinoma.  03/29/2007 the patient underwent a right lumpectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy revealing a 3.5 cm invasive ductal carcinoma which was estrogen receptor positive, progesterone receptor positive, and HER-2/neu. Sentinel lymph node biopsy was positive and therefore the patient underwent a full axillary lymph node dissection on 04/12/2007 revealing April 07 lymph nodes positive.  The patient received 4 cycles of Adriamycin and Cytoxan followed by 4 cycles of Taxotere.  January 2008 the patient completed radiation to the right breast.  March 2008 the patient started adjuvant tamoxifen.  However she had a CT scan of the chest abdomen and pelvis that revealed an abnormality in the left breast.  08/23/2008 the patient underwent an MRI of bilateral breasts revealing a 12 mm mass in the lower inner quadrant of the left breast.  10/11/2008 the patient underwent left breast mammogram revealing a \n suspicious mass in the left breast.  10/30/2008 the patient underwent a fine-needle aspiration that revealed an invasive ductal carcinoma which was estrogen receptor positive, progesterone receptor negative, and HER-2/neu negative.  12/18/2008 the patient underwent a left breast lumpectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy.  Pathology revealed a 1.5 cm grade 3 invasive ductal carcinoma which was estrogen receptor positive, progesterone receptor negative, and HER-2 negative by immunohistochemistry.  One out of the 3 sentinel lymph nodes was positive.  In December 2008 the patient had a completion axillary lymph node dissection and only 2 lymph nodes were seen both negative for cancer.  In January 2009, the patient initiated chemotherapy with Cytoxan, methotrexate, and 5-*****.  She also started Lupron at this time.  The patient underwent genetic testing and was negative for BRCA1 and 2.  08/27/2009 the patient underwent a CT scan of the chest abdomen and pelvis revealing enhancing tissue in the right anterior breast, a sclerotic focus in the left sacral ala, and a new sclerotic focus in the right anterior superior acetabulum. A bone scan on 09/04/2009 revealed no uptake to suggest osseous metastasis.  09/12/2009 the patient initiated postoperative radiation to the left breast, supraclavicular, and axillary regions receiving 1800 cGY to these regions.  09/20/2009, the patient underwent a core biopsy of a mass in the 12:00 position of the right breast which revealed a grade 1 invasive ductal carcinoma.  11/08/2009, the patient underwent a PET CT scan at ***** revealing skin thickening in the right breast, a 1.1 cm area of soft tissue enhancement in the right breast, no axillary or internal mammary adenopathy, and no clear evidence of distant metastatic disease.  12/14/2009 the patient underwent bilateral mastectomies, bilateral ***** flap reconstruction, and a left completion axillary \n dissection. Pathology from the left breast revealed no cancer, and 0/8 axillary lymph nodes contained metastatic cancer.  However in the right breast mastectomy specimen, there was was 2 cm of grade 1 invasive ductal cancer.  0 of 6 lymph nodes removed contained cancer on the right side.  The invasive cancer was again estrogen receptor positive, progesterone receptor negative, and HER-2/neu negative.  November 2009 the patient initiated letrozole.  October 2010 the patient began to experience some lightheadedness when standing.  She then developed more severe headaches.  Finally she noted a lump in the left side of her neck.  12/06/2010 the patient underwent a fine-needle aspiration of a left supraclavicular lymph node which revealed metastatic adenocarcinoma which was very weakly estrogen receptor positive with only 1-5% of the cells staining, progesterone receptor negative, and HER-2/neu negative.  12/11/2010 the patient underwent a PET CT scan which revealed a new right frontal dural based metastasis with SUV of 28.2 with surrounding vasogenic edema and mass effect.  The scan also revealed multiple hypermetabolic left cervical and supraclavicular lymph nodes consistent with metastatic disease.  There was hypermetabolism along the right parasternal chest wall consistent with recurrent disease possibly invading the sternum.  There was also bilateral subpectoral lymphadenopathy with maximum SUV of 11.4 on the left and 4.1 on the right.  There was an area of focal hypermetabolism in the hepatic segment ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** a maximum SUV of 7.0 suspicious for early hepatic metastasis.  There was multifocal osseous metastatic disease identified within the C2, L2 vertebral bodies as well as in the sacrum.  12/11/2010 the patient underwent an MRI of the brain which revealed a 4 cm left inferior frontal extra-axial mass new since 11/08/2009.  Patient met with radiation oncology as \n well as neurosurgery to discuss treatment options.  12/30/2010 the patient underwent resection of the frontal brain metastasis.  Pathology confirmed that it was consistent with a metastatic adenocarcinoma of breast primary, and was estrogen receptor negative, progesterone receptor negative, and HER-2/neu negative.  02/10/2011 - Whole brain RT: 30 gray in 10 fractions  03/01/2011 - Started Xeloda 4000mg (actually took 2000mg) daily 14 days on 7 days off  03/12/2011 - PET/CT (during cycle 1 Xeloda) with PD including liver, bones, LNs, breast.
