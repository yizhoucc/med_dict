I emphasized that these options would not likely enhance her longevity.  I also pointed out that by the MSKCC nomogram for DCIS recurrence risk, inputting her age and all other features, her 10 year risk might be closer to 15%, but that XRT +/- endocrine therapy would provide significant risk reduction that she should consider further after her pending UCSF Rad Onc consultation. We also discussed the side effects and MSS and bone density complications of aromatase inhibitor therapy given her present diagnosis of osteopenia, and how this latter risk could be mitigated with bisphosphonate therapy.

Left breast, deep margin, excision: Benign skeletal muscle and  fibroadipose tissue.  D. Left breast, anterior margin over DCIS, excision: Benign  fibroadipose tissue.     Assessment and Plan:  ***** ***** ***** is a 63 y.o. female with ***** +/ ***** negative invasive carcinoma with ductal and lobular features. We reviewed her work-up to date and her pathology result. I explained that her cancer is low risk and I do not recommend adjuvant chemotherapy. Because her breast cancer is strongly estrogen receptor positive, we discussed beginning an endocrine based therapy, specifically letrozole. She understands that she will receive at least five years of adjuvant hormonal therapy.     In terms of hormonal therapy, I explained that aromatase inhibitors have been shown to have improved outcomes in terms of DFS as compared to tamoxifen. I also discussed the data from ***** and ***** which demonstrated modest benefit of extending hormonal therapy beyond 5 years. I explained that the decision to continue the aromatase inhibitor beyond 5 years should be an individualized decision based on the patient's risk and tolerance of hormonal therapy.    I reviewed the anticipated side effects and risks associated with an \n aromatase inhibitors including arthralgias, urogenital atrophy, and possible acceleration of bone density loss. I explained that the joint pains are often the most difficult side effect to manage, and not infrequently, patients will switch to another aromatase inhibitor, and if not able to tolerate, we will consider switching to a different ***** or tamoxifen.    I have ordered a base line DEXA. We briefly discussed the role of bone targeted therapies. We will have a more in depth discussion of these therapies once she is further along in treatment. In the interim, I encouraged her to maintain a calcium rich diet, take in an adequate amount of Vitamin D (typically at least *****-***** ***** per day in a post-menopausal patient without much sun exposure) and engage in weight bearing exercise.  I  encouraged exercise to meet the goal of 150 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity per week since this has been associated with improvement in breast cancer specific and overall survival among breast cancer patients.      F/U: 3 months     Patient ready and able to be educated, verbalizes understanding of information/instructions given.

BI-RADS 4A.     09/23/15 right breast stereotactic guided bx of 3 o'clock calcifications pathology:  -R breast w/ calcification: ADH with associated mucin extravasation, proliferative and non-proliferative fibrocystic changes with microcalcifications  -R breast w/o calcification: proliferative and non-proliferative fibrocystic changes    12/02/15 right breast excision with needle localization pathology showed focal ADH, proliferative and non-proliferative fibrocystic changes with microcalcifications, benign glandular microcalcifications,     06/13/17 bilateral screening mammo showed ***** in either breast.     09/22/18 bilateral diagnostic mammogram showed a 6.4cm irregularly shaped masses with obscured margins and associated fine pleomorphic calcifications. New \n right axillary LN with irregular morphology. U/s showed multiple solid hypoechoic irregular vascular masses, together measuring 50 x 21 x 55mm extending from 9:00 3cm from nipple to 9:00 7cm from nipple. Abnormal right axillary LN at 11:00, 15cm from nipple with focal cortical thickening up to 6mm. Left breast benign.     09/29/18 right breast FNA of 9 o'clock masses showed adenocarcinoma with mucinous differentiation; ER+ (90%), PR+ (30%), ***** equivocal (2) by IHC, neg by FISH (ratio 1.1)    10/05/18 PETCT showed slight hypermetabolism within right breast lesion, corresponding to patient's biopsy proven malignancy. No definite sites of hypermetabolic metastatic disease.  2.  Enhancing lesion within segment 8 of liver, incompletely characterized, but without significant hypermetabolism.    10/06/18 ***** axillary node FNA pathology was neg     10/26/18 ***** partial mastectomy with new anterior inferior margin excision and R axillary ***** pathology showed:  -5.***** *****(sn) Grade II micropapillary ***** of  mucinous carcinoma ER+ (>95%), PR+ (80%), ***** equiv by IHC (2) neg by FISH, ***** 5% . No *****, 2 sln ***** of micropapillary mucinous carcinoma (0.4mm) out of 4 ***** examined. No *****. Associated with ADH, multiple intraductal *****, cystically dilated ducts containing mucin, mucinous secretions within nipple ducts (no carcinoma identified in nipple), sclerosing adenosis, radial sclerosing lesion  -negative margins    10/23/18 A/P CT quad phase showed hypervascular mass in the liver measuring 1.9 cm with a hemangioma demonstrating discontinuous nodular enhancement with gradual fill in, several scattered subcentimeter hypervascular foci throughout the liver, could be due to flash filling. Additionally there is also a hypervascular mass in segment 6 measuring 3.5 cm which is mildly hypervascular demonstrating more homogeneous enhancement. This most likely represents a focal nodular hyperplasia. Hepatic lesions felt \n to be benign.     Feels well post-surgery.  For right axillary pain, she takes ***** q3-4hrs prn. Ibuprofen not enough.     Aside from her breast issues, she has L ankle torn ligament and sciatica. Taking *****, cymbalta, flexeril.
