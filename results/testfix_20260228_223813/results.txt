She has ***** General Medicine history of care at ***** for osteopenia, dyslipidemia, impaired glucose tolerance, and also general health screening. Her recent mammographic screen (on 10/09/2018, compared with 05/10/2016 and earlier screens) identified an increase in suspicious, segmental, heterogeneously dense microcalcifications in her right upper outer breast; and imaged guided biopsy of these calcifications showed intermediate grade DCIS, ER+ (98%) PR+ (90%).  Her right breast 11/08/2018 stereotactic core biopsy showed intermediate grade DCIS associated with calcifications; and her ***** localized right upper quadrant partial mastectomy on 12/28/2017 showed intermediate nuclear grade DCIS, mixed solid papillary, cribiform pattern with some comedo necrosis, no invasive ductal cancer but DCIS spanning ~5.0 cm (9 contiguous slices), clear surgical margins.

Apart from colonoscopy screening several years ago, she has never had any other surgical procedure.

I discussed with her Dr. *****'s recommendation that she be evaluated by Rad Onc and Med Onc to consider both adjuvant XRT and endocrine therapy to minimize \n her future risk of recurrent DCIS or progression to invasive ductal cancer over next decade, given her overall excellent health and likelihood of living another 20 years. I informed her that, overall, patients with DCIS may have up to 25-30% recurrence risk which could be reduced to 15% or less if given breast XRT; and that adjuvant endocrine therapy (e.g. aromatase inhibitor like Arimidex) for 5 years after XRT would further reduce her risk to 5-8% and provide lifelong chemoprotectant benefit for her uninvolved (left) breast. I emphasized that these options would not likely enhance her longevity.  I also pointed out that by the MSKCC nomogram for DCIS recurrence risk, inputting her age and all other features, her 10 year risk might be closer to 15%, but that XRT +/- endocrine therapy would provide significant risk reduction that she should consider further after her pending UCSF Rad Onc consultation. We also discussed the side effects and MSS and bone density complications of aromatase inhibitor therapy given her present diagnosis of osteopenia, and how this latter risk could be mitigated with bisphosphonate therapy.       Plan:       She is inclined toward undertaking additional adjuvant treatment(s) to minimize her risks over the next decade of recurrent DCIS or progression to invasive breast cancer. She understands and looks forward to her ***** evaluation in two weeks which requires her first decision. She will then plan to return for ***** follow-up visit in 3-4 months allowing time to complete right breast XRT if that option is recommended and accepted.         \n"
