I emphasized that these options would not likely enhance her longevity.  I also pointed out that by the MSKCC nomogram for DCIS recurrence risk, inputting her age and all other features, her 10 year risk might be closer to 15%, but that XRT +/- endocrine therapy would provide significant risk reduction that she should consider further after her pending UCSF Rad Onc consultation. We also discussed the side effects and MSS and bone density complications of aromatase inhibitor therapy given her present diagnosis of osteopenia, and how this latter risk could be mitigated with bisphosphonate therapy.
