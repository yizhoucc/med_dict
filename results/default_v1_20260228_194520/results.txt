IMPORTANT classification rules:
- "bowel regimen" means laxatives, stool softeners, anti-diarrheals (e.g., docusate, miralax, lomotil, imodium). Antibiotics like doxycycline are NOT bowel regimen — classify them under "other treatment" or "infection management".

She does say she felt really sick, like crap, and had lots of back pain and constipation.  States she felt fine 1 week after chemotherapy.

Left breast, mag seed-localized partial mastectomy:   1. Tumor bed with chronic inflammation.  2. Biopsy site changes.   3. Proliferative fibrocystic change with focal usual ductal hyperplasia  (*****) and sclerosing adenosis.  4. See comment.     B. Left breast, new margin, resection:   Benign breast tissue. See comment.    C. Left axillary lymph nodes, dissection:    1. Metastatic ductal carcinoma in three of twenty eight lymph nodes  (May 22).  2. Extracapsular extension.   3. Treatment effect.   4. Necrotizing lymphadenitis.  5. See comment.      D. Left axillary lymph node, level 3, dissection:   1. Necrotizing lymphadenitis.  2. Two of two lymph nodes with no tumor identified (0/2).   3. See comment.    COMMENT:  The partial mastectomy specimen (part A) was extensively sampled.  Sections reveal benign breast tissue with biopsy site changes and  treatment effect. To confirm the diagnosis, immunohistochemical stains  were performed on blocks A11 and A12 at ***** with the following results:  Stain     Target     Result  Keratin     Epithelial cells     Negative for invasive carcinoma (A11  and A12)  P63     Myoepithelium     Negative (A11)  SMM   \n    Myoepithelium     Negative (A11)    The immunohistochemical staining pattern supports the morphologic  findings and rules against an occult invasive carcinoma in part A.     The immunohistochemical staining pattern supports the morphologic  findings. Positive staining for ***** along with positive MPO in  histiocytes is compatible with ***** ***** lymphadenitis. Positive  staining for T cell markers without loss of specific markers, favors a  non-neoplastic process. The CD30 stain highlights ***** and  negative staining for CD15 rules against Hodgkin lymphoma. B cell  markers are negative, ruling against a B cell lymphoma. Negative  staining for keratin and CD68 and ***** rules against a histiocytic  process or fulminant treatment effect in the lymph node. Overall, the  findings support a diagnosis of necrotizing lymphadenitis. The  differential diagnosis includes ***** ***** disease, which is  favored, as well as lymphadenitis secondary to systemic lupus  erythematous. Serologic testing for lupus to rule out the diagnosis is  recommended.     ***** ***** is a self-limiting auto-immune disorder which presents  as acute or sub-acute lymphadenitis over the course of several weeks.  The differential diagnosis includes T cell lymphoma, which is largely  excluded in this case by IHC staining as well as lupus which can have  similar ***** (ref 1).

I have stated to ***** that she is at great risk of developing metastatic breast cancer due to her incomplete course of systemic therapy for her high risk disease.  We discussed in detail why she was unable to adhere to the standard treatment as recommended.  She states family members discouraged her from receiving chemotherapy, that she did not feel supported in the management of her symptoms due to her treatment, and that logistically she found it difficult to come in for appointments.      I reiterated to her that she is at great risk of developing metastatic breast cancer which is not curable, and that she can reduce this risk by proceeding with recommended systemic therapy of ***** followed by T-DM1.  I stated that if she were able to commit to this treatment I would do all I and my team can to provide the support she needs to manage symptoms.  I discussed with her the typical SE associated with AC, such as  fatigue, myelosuppression, nausea, hair loss, and brain fog.  Also mentioned risks of cardiomyopathy and secondary leukemia.  Briefly discussed side-effects associated with T-DM1, such as *****, bleeding, and neuropathy.      I reiterated the importance of radiation after \n completing AC.    I have sent ***** a detailed description of AC and the steps that would need to be taken in order to start, including port placement and echocardiogram.  We will aim to speak again this coming week.  ***** states that she will consider this recommendation and also that she understands she is at great risk of MBC.    Recommendations in *****:  - adjuvant AC x 4 cycles, to be followed by T-DM1  - radiation    I spent a total of 80 minutes face-to-face with the patient and >50% of that time was spent counseling regarding the diagnosis, the treatment plan, the prognosis, medication risks, lifestyle modification, symptoms and therapeutic options.  \n"

"Assessment and Recommendations:  29 y.o. premenopausal patient with a history of clinical stage III *****-/*****+ IDC of the left breast, who received an incomplete course of neoadjuvant TCHP (as detailed above), followed by left lumpectomy/ALND with no residual disease in breast but 3 of 28 LN positive for *****-/*****+ adenocarcinoma, who should proceed with adjuvant ***** followed by 1 year of T-DM1.
