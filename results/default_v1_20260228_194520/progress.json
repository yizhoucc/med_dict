On exam 1 cm firm, mobile, nontender mass approximately 5 cm from nipple at 1 o'clock.  03/17/2019: Right breast FNA at 1 o'clock (UCSF): Benign and could be seen in the setting of fibrocystic change or fibroadenoma.  03/17/2018 Abdomen-pelvic CT: No acute findings (for abdominal pain).  03/28/2019 Bilateral breast diagnostic mammogram (UCSF): A focal asymmetry is suggested in the region. Triangular marker denotes site of focal pain in the lower slightly outer right breast, with no underlying mammographic correlate. Scattered and occasionally grouped benign-appearing microcalcifications, both breasts, predominantly coarse dystrophic, likely the sequelae of reported fat grafting.  03/28/2019 Bilateral breast diagnostic US(UCSF): 22 x 10 x 15 mm oval complex solid and cystic mass with peripheral echogenicity and an irregular, antiparallel hypoechoic central component in the right upper inner quadrant, 1:00, 8 cm from nipple. The central hypoechoic component measures up to 10 mm. No sonographic correlate to site of focal pain in the lower outer right breast at 7 o'clock, 5 cm from nipple. No sonographic correlate to clinician's site of concern in the left axilla. A few normal-appearing nodes are identified. \n Left breast: benign  03/30/2019 Right breast US guided core biopsy at 1 o'clock 8 cm from nipple (UCSF): Grade 1 IDC, ER+(>95%), PR(~90% ranging from weak to strong nuclear staining), ***** equivocal(IHC 2), FISH non-amplified (0.55 cm largest dimension in a core; multiple core involved), *****-67: ~10%.
