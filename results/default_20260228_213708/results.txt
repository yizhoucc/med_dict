This improved after completing physical therapy.     5. Osteoporosis, currently on *****. The patient's baseline bone density scan showed osteoporosis in the low back. She had a repeat bone density scan last July 2018 which showed slight improvement of bone density at the femur neck with T-score (-2.4) now in the osteopenia range. The T-scores of her lumbar spine and femur are stable from last year which is in the osteopenia range. Advised patient to continue calcium and Vitamin D supplements and to continue weight bearing exercises. ***** continue monitor DEXA scan. If the patient's BMD falls below -2.5, she will need to see a dentist, then we could start the her on Prolia 60 mg SQ every 6 months. We can check again her DEXA in 1 year to assess change, due July 2019.     6. Headaches, intermittent, chronic: Seek care if worsening. Advised to follow-up with PCP. If worsening, consider brain MRI.     7. Loose stools, grade 1, mostly after meals. Discussed trying daily probiotics.        Follow up in 6 months or sooner if she has new or worsening symptoms.     I spent a total of 40 minutes face-to-face with the patient and 30 minutes of that time was spent counseling regarding the treatment plan, symptoms and therapeutic options.         \n"

She states she has had to move a few times during her diagnosis and had a difficult timing continuing with care in part due to the distance.  She states that she had multiple episodes of dysuria (\"pain down there\") for which she had antibiotics, but that this was the most difficult part of chemotherapy.  She does say she felt really sick, like crap, and had lots of back pain and constipation.  States she felt fine 1 week after chemotherapy.  States that many family members have told her she should not get chemotherapy as it will harm her.  Feels she has recovered from her surgery.  Has an oncologist at *****.

Left breast, mag seed-localized partial mastectomy:   1. Tumor bed with chronic inflammation.  2. Biopsy site changes.   3. Proliferative fibrocystic change with focal usual ductal hyperplasia  (*****) and sclerosing adenosis.  4. See comment.     B. Left breast, new margin, resection:   Benign breast tissue. See comment.    C. Left axillary lymph nodes, dissection:    1. Metastatic ductal carcinoma in three of twenty eight lymph nodes  (May 22).  2. Extracapsular extension.   3. Treatment effect.   4. Necrotizing lymphadenitis.  5. See comment.      D. Left axillary lymph node, level 3, dissection:   1. Necrotizing lymphadenitis.  2. Two of two lymph nodes with no tumor identified (0/2).   3. See comment.    COMMENT:  The partial mastectomy specimen (part A) was extensively sampled.  Sections reveal benign breast tissue with biopsy site changes and  treatment effect. To confirm the diagnosis, immunohistochemical stains  were performed on blocks A11 and A12 at ***** with the following results:  Stain     Target     Result  Keratin     Epithelial cells     Negative for invasive carcinoma (A11  and A12)  P63     Myoepithelium     Negative (A11)  SMM   \n    Myoepithelium     Negative (A11)    The immunohistochemical staining pattern supports the morphologic  findings and rules against an occult invasive carcinoma in part A.     The immunohistochemical staining pattern supports the morphologic  findings. Positive staining for ***** along with positive MPO in  histiocytes is compatible with ***** ***** lymphadenitis. Positive  staining for T cell markers without loss of specific markers, favors a  non-neoplastic process. The CD30 stain highlights ***** and  negative staining for CD15 rules against Hodgkin lymphoma. B cell  markers are negative, ruling against a B cell lymphoma. Negative  staining for keratin and CD68 and ***** rules against a histiocytic  process or fulminant treatment effect in the lymph node. Overall, the  findings support a diagnosis of necrotizing lymphadenitis. The  differential diagnosis includes ***** ***** disease, which is  favored, as well as lymphadenitis secondary to systemic lupus  erythematous. Serologic testing for lupus to rule out the diagnosis is  recommended.     ***** ***** is a self-limiting auto-immune disorder which presents  as acute or sub-acute lymphadenitis over the course of several weeks.  The differential diagnosis includes T cell lymphoma, which is largely  excluded in this case by IHC staining as well as lupus which can have  similar ***** (ref 1).

Multiple bilateral pulmonary parenchymal nodules are present. Left lower lobe nodule measures up to 8 mm and multiple additional nodules are identified, many \n nodules or pleural-based. There are areas of subsegmental atelectasis in both lungs. There are no pleural effusions. Mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy identified. Mediastinal lymph nodes measure up to 15 mm. Largest hilar lymph nodes are present with a left hilar lymph node measuring up to 15 mm. There are multiple enlarged cardiophrenic angle lymph nodes. There are enlarged internal mammary lymph nodes on the right. There is extensive right axillary lymphadenopathy. Nodes measure up to 21 x 18 mm. Multiple nodules are present in the upper inner right breast, one of which is inseparable from the underlying pectoral muscles. There is skin thickening over the central breast and there is an irregularly marginated mass within the breast centrally located above the nipple measuring over 6 cm. There are multiple small lymph nodes in the upper abdomen. Portacaval lymph node measures up to 30 x 15 mm. Small  para-aortic lymph nodes are also present less than 1 cm. There is widespread osseous metastatic disease. Pathologic destruction of multiple ribs and extensive distraction of the sternum involving body of the sternum as well as the manubrium. There is involvement of the thoracic spine most severe at T10 where there is involvement of the vertebral body the pedicle and there is intraspinal extension along the right and lateral aspects of the canal. There is involvement of the right pedicle L1 as well.  02/10/18 MRI Lumbar spine w/ and w/o contrast: Abnormal marrow signal with replacement of normal marrow throughout the lumbosacral spine consistent with metastatic infiltration. Sacral tissues are also infiltrated. There is mild fracture of the inferior endplate of L1 on the right side. T12 inferior endplate demonstrates fracture mild loss of height as well. Epidural contrast enhancement ventrally and dorsally consistent with metastases. This is ***** at L5 level. Abnormal replacement of the marrow signal with tumor \n enhancement along the sacral foramina and sacral canal. T12-L1: Areas mild epidural tumor at T12 compressing the thecal sac ventrally. L1-L2: Mild facet hypertrophy and mild central stenosis. L2-L3: Mild dural thickening and facet hypertrophy. L3-L4: Is asymmetrical epidural fat compressing the thecal sac with moderate stenosis. It is mild dural enhancement. There is mild tumor enhancement posterior to the psoas muscle on the right side at L4. Measures approximately 12 mm. L4-L5: Disc bulge and right sided small disc herniation resulting in right lateral recess and neural foraminal stenosis. Mild dural contrast enhancement. L5-S1: There is no central skull tumor. There is epidural thickening. This is extending from S1 segment.  02/10/17 MRI Thoracic spine w/ and w/o contrast: Thoracic metastases throughout the spine. Minimal compression of T6. There is spinal CORD compression due to epidural tumor and thickening from approximately T5-T9. There is separate mild epidural tumor and thecal sac and cord deformity at T12. The epidural enhancement is contiguous throughout the thoracic spine.  02/10/17 MRI Cervical spine w/ and w/o contrast: Heterogeneous marrow signal throughout the cervical spine consistent with metastatic replacement. No epidural tumor. No intraspinal meningeal contrast enhancement. C5-C6: Mild bulge with mild central stenosis.  02/10/17 Bone scan: Multiple focal areas of increased activity are visualized in the skull, cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine, multiple ribs bilaterally sternum, pelvis, proximal humeri, hips and femurs. Findings correlates with lesions seen on MRI and are consistent with widespread metastatic involvement.Of incidental note, there is no evidence of mass abnormality of the kidneys or obstructive uropathy.   02/10/17 MRI Brain: Small dural based metastases are present along the posterior interhemispheric falx and right parietal convexity. These measure approximately 1 cm or less. \n There is no edema in the adjacent brain parenchyma. Ureteral based metastases are present along the posterior interhemispheric falx and parasagittal convexity bilaterally. There is no edema in the adjacent brain parenchyma. Additionally, small punctate foci of contrast enhancement are noted in the right cerebellar hemisphere inferiorly and posteriorly. It is not clear whether these are small parenchymal metastases or meningeal tumor. There is an approximately 15 mm  metastases in the upper clivus (skull).   02/10/17: BRCA1/2 negative.  02/11/17 CT A/P w/ contrast: Right breast skin thickening is partially imaged. Minimal bibasilar atelectasis. Right lower lobe posterior medial soft tissue thickening along the pleural surface. Few small right cardiophrenic angle lymph nodes are more numerous than normally seen. Small retroperitoneal lymph nodes are predominantly under 1 cm. Extensive bony lytic destructive appearance to the left inferior pubic ramus with subacute/healing fractures suggested. Old right inferior pubic ramus fracture is also seen as well as lytic appearance of the left greater than right acetabulum. Small nondisplaced fracture of the left sacral ala likely pathologic with diffuse osseous metastatic involvement of the sacrum and iliac bones as well as throughout the lumbar vertebral bodies and in multiple ribs. Several healing left and right rib fractures are seen also likely pathologic. Mild degenerative disc disease L4-5.Several endplate compression fracture deformities, for example, inferior endplate compression of T12. Large lytic lesion destroys and replaces much of T10.  02/11/17 bilateral diagnostic mammogram and limited right breast US: The breast tissue is fatty with scattered fibroglandular elements. In the right breast at 12 o'clock middle third, there is a large spiculated mass containing numerous suspicious calcifications.There is diffuse overlying skin thickening as well. No suspicious findings \n are seen in the left breast on mammography. High-resolution ultrasound of the right breast: At 12 o'clock, 2 cm from the nipple, there is a hypoechoic heterogeneous irregularly shaped mass measuring at least 10 x 5 x 7 cm corresponding to mammographic findings and palpable mass. In the right axilla, there is a 25 mm lymph node with thickened cortex that is suspicious for additional metastases.  02/14/17 CT-guided biopsy of the posterior superior left iliac bone: +metastatic adenocarcinoma of breast origin, ER+(76%)/PR+(33%)/*****+ (IHC 3+, no FISH done)  02/14/17 *****-guided biopsy of R breast mass: +IDC, moderately differentiated, ER+(97%)/PR+(79%)/*****+ (IHC 3+/FISH 15.April 10=5.4)  02/18/17: EF 76%  02/18/17 CT A/P due to hypotension and lower extremity weakness: stable compared to 02/11/17 but new left gluteus medius intermuscular hematoma.  02/18/17: new anemia of unclear etiology other than new hematoma (site of bone biopsy)  *****/*****/*****- *****/*****/***** complete 10 fractions (30 Gy) to T spine  02/23/17: start herceptin and ***** (no chemo given due to anemia), start letrozole  03/14/17: second dose herceptin and *****  03/18/17: discharged to ***** *****, *****, ***** for rehab  04/20/17: Consult Dr. ***** (UCSF), only on letrozole at this point, no h/p since *****  05/04/17: start taxotere 75mg/m2 and resume herceptin and *****  *****/*****/***** - *****/*****/*****: admitted locally with severe sepsis, neutropenic fever, n/v  *****/*****: second dose taxotere 75mg/m2, herceptin and *****  *****/*****/***** - *****/*****/*****: admitted locally anemia, mucositis, neutropenic fever, n/v  06/15/17: start taxol 80mg/m2 and continue herceptin and *****  *****/*****/***** - *****/*****/*****: admitted locally with severe sepsis, neutropenic fever, n/v  07/02/17 CT Chest w/ contrast (nothing available for comparison): Previously seen mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy not mentioned. Previously seen lung nodules and pleural thickening not seen. Bilateral pleural effusions are seen, moderate on the \n right and small to moderate on the left. The skeleton has a diffusely heterogeneously sclerotic appearance, consistent with widespread bony metastatic disease. Multiple rib fractures are seen bilaterally, mostly with callus formation and likely subacute or older. Ascites is seen around the liver and spleen.  07/03/17: EF 65-70%  07/06/17 CT CAP w/contrast: Stable in chest compared to 07/02/17.

Limited pulmonary exam secondary to suboptimal contrast bolus timing and respiratory motion. Moderate right and small left pleural effusions. Small pericardial effusion.  11/01/17 MRI brain (compared to ***** brain 10/20/2017): An enhancing lesion measuring 6 mm is identified within the left caudate head. There are additional smaller lesions with intrinsic T1 hyperintensity and possible enhancement within the bilateral caudate heads. There is a punctate focus of magnetic susceptibility signal with associated linear enhancement within the left cingulate gyrus. There is a questionable punctate focus of enhancement within the left hippocampus.

We discussed that DCIS is a surgical disease. The primary treatment is definitive surgery which she has had. I encouraged to meet with radiation oncology to discuss adjuvant radiation and its benefit in reducing local/regional recurrence. I explained that DCIS can return 50% of the time as another insitu disease and 50% of the time as invasive disease, but technically it should not result in distant recurrence due to lack of invasion. We discussed the role of systemic therapy with tamoxifen. We reviewed the ***** B-24 study that did show a statistically significant reduction in recurrence risk with 5 years of *****, albeit the benefit was small and the side effects are not insignificant.

"ASSESSMENT/PLAN:  *****-***** ***** is a 41 y.o. female with recently diagnosed left nuclear grade 2 ER+ DCIS s/p left partial mastectomy here to discuss systemic therapy options.     We discussed that DCIS is a surgical disease. The primary treatment is definitive surgery which she has had. I encouraged to meet with radiation oncology to discuss adjuvant radiation and its benefit in reducing local/regional recurrence. I explained that DCIS can return 50% of the time as another insitu disease and 50% of the time as invasive disease, but technically it should not result in distant recurrence due to lack of invasion. We discussed the role of systemic therapy with tamoxifen. We reviewed the ***** B-24 study that did show a statistically significant reduction in recurrence risk with 5 years of *****, albeit the benefit was small and the side effects are not insignificant. In particular the reduction in invasive disease was 3% with tamoxifen, the remaining benefit in non-invasive disease.  No difference in distant recurrence or survival.

"This is a shared visit for services provided by Dr. ***** ***** and myself.      SUBJECTIVE    ***** ***** ***** is a 58 y.o. female with de ***** metastatic ER+ breast cancer to bone, liver and nodes who is currently on faslodex on 07/14/18 and palbociclib on 07/22/18. She's s/p extensive spine surgery on 08/03/2018 for tumor debulking and spine stabilization. She received postoperative radiotherapy to the spine including T1 through T10 on *****/*****/*****-*****/*****/18, she only received total of 6 treatments (supposed to get 10 total radiation treatments) due to esophagitis. She is here today for follow-up.     ***** to ***** for treatment, which was supposed to be a 6 week program. Only completed 4, the clinic used the same treatment everyone. ***** to another clinic for the last 2 weeks, which she thought was more help. Treatment was individualized.    Stopped taking Ibrance and Fulvestrant end of January. Last dose of Fulvestrant was 01/04/19. Did ***** test, which test her blood for responsive to different types of tx. Test showed she is only 20% responsive to palbociclib and 10% to fulvestrant. Doing low dose chemo at home - ***** 10 mg, Gemcitabine 200mg, Docetaxel 20 mg once weekly on Sunday. On Saturday and Tuesday, she does \"metabolic therapy\". Also receiving immunological vaccines once a week. Receive pamidronate once weekly. ***** do this for 2 months and then return to ***** ***** an evaluation. Port placed in *****. Cancelled CT CAP on February 27 because she was told she cannot imaging within 3 months.     Nerve pain her lower right rib pain is overall slightly improved. Pain varies and can be intermittent, worse with movement. Feels like \"ripping\" and burning pain that can radiate towards the lower mid abdomen. Taking supplement \"nerve support\" with some relief when she first started it but now she's unsure if it's helping. Also taking sulfur. Using CBD (without THC) at night to help her sleep. When she was in *****, she \n received vitamin B infusions and steroids, they initially helped but stopped. Stopped Gabapentin and *****.      Lower back is less numb, about to feel more pain. Mobility is better. ***** start PT on 03/12/19. Has intermittent cramping in her feet. Taking magnesium supplement with relief.     No N/V. Appetite is good. When she was in *****, food was prepared for her and ate well. Now that she is home she has to cook for herself and eating one meal a day and snacking on fruits. Bowel movements are loose since starting magnesium.       ROS  All systems reviewed and negative except for as outlined above in the HPI.

COMPARISON:07/02/2016    REPORT: By discussion and use of the consent form, risks, benefits and  alternatives were covered.Signed informed consent was obtained.    The left breast was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion. The hypoechoic  mass at the 6:00 periareolar position was again identified sonographically.  Buffered 1% lidocaine was used for local anesthesia with additional buffered 1%  lidocaine with epinephrine for deep anesthesia. A nick was made in the skin  using 11 blade scalpel.
