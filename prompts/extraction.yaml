Reason_for_Visit: |
  TASK: Extract 'Reason for Visit'.
  Be SPECIFIC — include the patient's diagnosis, cancer type, and the purpose of this visit.
  Do NOT give vague answers like "new symptoms" or "follow up visit". Instead, state what cancer,
  what stage (if known), and what specifically brought them in (e.g., "initial consult for newly
  diagnosed metastatic ER+ breast cancer" or "cycle 3 day 1 of irinotecan for metastatic TNBC").
  Respond *only* with a JSON object using this exact schema:
  {
  "Patient type": "either New patient or follow up",
  "second opinion": "whether the visit is consultation/second opinion or not",
  "in-person": "either Televisit or in-person. (note, video consult, televisit, telehealth are the same thing)",
  "summary": "A specific summary including cancer type, stage if known, and purpose of this visit."
  }

What_We_Found: |
  TASK: Extract 'What We Found'.

  For Type_of_Cancer, be SPECIFIC — include:
  - Histologic subtype: IDC (invasive ductal carcinoma), ILC (invasive lobular carcinoma), DCIS, mixed, etc.
  - Receptor status if mentioned: ER+/PR+/HER2-, triple negative, etc.
  - Example: "ER+/PR+/HER2- invasive ductal carcinoma" NOT just "breast cancer"
  Do NOT write just "breast cancer" or "MBC" — always include the subtype and receptor status when available in the note.

  For Stage_of_Cancer:
  - Write the AJCC/TNM stage if stated (e.g., "Stage IIA", "pT2N0M0", "Stage IV")
  - If the patient was originally diagnosed at one stage but now has metastatic recurrence, write BOTH:
    e.g., "Originally Stage IIA, now metastatic (Stage IV)"
  - If only grade or tumor size is mentioned without a formal stage, write what is available (e.g., "Grade 2, 2.3 cm tumor")
  - If no staging information exists in the note, write "Not mentioned in note"

  For lab_summary, list SPECIFIC lab values and results (e.g., "Hgb 7.7, Albumin 2.1, Alk Phos 183").
  Do NOT substitute imaging results for lab results.
  For findings, summarize NEW clinical findings or current disease status from this visit.
  Respond *only* with a JSON object using this exact schema:
  {
  "Type_of_Cancer": "Specific cancer type with histologic subtype and receptor status. e.g., 'ER+/PR+/HER2- invasive ductal carcinoma'",
  "Stage_of_Cancer": "AJCC stage, or original + current if recurred/progressed. e.g., 'Stage IIA' or 'Originally Stage IIA, now metastatic'",
  "Distant Metastasis": "if there is distant metastasis (met). Yes, to where; No, local, not sure, need more evidence such as imaging.",
  "Metastasis": "if there is met, Yes (to where), No, or Not sure",
  "lab_summary": "Summary of key lab results with specific values. Only include laboratory tests (blood work), NOT imaging.",
  "findings": "Summary of new findings or disease status."
  }

Treatment_Summary: |
  TASK: Extract 'Treatment Summary'.
  Respond *only* with a JSON object using this exact schema:
  {
  "current_meds": "List of current oncologic medications or regimens.",
  "recent_changes": "Any holds, dose reductions, or switches.",
  "supportive_meds": "List of supportive medications."
  }

Goals_of_care: |
  TASK: Extract 'What We Discussed / Decided'.

  For goals_of_treatment:
  - Write the INTENT of the cancer treatment itself: "curative", "palliative", "risk reduction", "adjuvant", "neoadjuvant", or "symptom management".
  - Do NOT write the purpose of this visit (e.g., "follow-up", "discuss treatment options", "review treatment plan").
  - If the note discusses reducing recurrence risk, write "risk reduction".
  - If the note discusses palliative care or life-prolonging treatment for metastatic disease, write "palliative".
  - If treatment aims to cure, write "curative".

  For response_assessment:
  - Write how the cancer is CURRENTLY responding based on evidence already available.
  - Look for: imaging results, tumor markers, clinical exam findings, symptom changes.
  - Do NOT include future plans ("will start", "plan to", "she will have radiation").
  - Do NOT include treatment discussions or recommendations.
  - If the patient is newly diagnosed and has NOT yet started treatment, write "Not yet on treatment — no response to assess."
  - If there is no mention of disease status or treatment response anywhere in the note, write "Not mentioned in note."
  - Do NOT write "Not applicable" or "Not specified".
  Examples:
  - GOOD: "CT stable, CA 15-3 decreased from 28 to 14"
  - GOOD: "no evidence of disease recurrence on imaging and exam"
  - GOOD: "tolerating therapy well, symptoms improved"
  - BAD: "She will continue on letrozole and have radiation" (this is a plan, not a response)
  - BAD: "We discussed chemotherapy options" (this is a discussion, not a response)

  Respond *only* with a JSON object using this exact schema:
  {
  "goals_of_treatment": "The intent of cancer treatment: curative, palliative, risk reduction, adjuvant, neoadjuvant, or symptom management. NOT the purpose of this visit.",
  "response_assessment": "How is the cancer CURRENTLY responding? Cite specific evidence already available: imaging, labs, exam, symptoms. Do NOT include future plans."
  }
