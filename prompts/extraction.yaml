Reason_for_Visit: |
  TASK: Extract 'Reason for Visit'.
  Be SPECIFIC — include the patient's diagnosis, cancer type, and the purpose of this visit.
  Do NOT give vague answers like "new symptoms" or "follow up visit". Instead, state what cancer,
  what stage (if known), and what specifically brought them in (e.g., "initial consult for newly
  diagnosed metastatic ER+ breast cancer" or "cycle 3 day 1 of irinotecan for metastatic TNBC").
  Respond *only* with a JSON object using this exact schema:
  {
  "Patient type": "either New patient or follow up",
  "second opinion": "whether the visit is consultation/second opinion or not",
  "in-person": "either Televisit or in-person. (note, video consult, televisit, telehealth are the same thing)",
  "summary": "A specific summary including cancer type, stage if known, and purpose of this visit."
  }

What_We_Found: |
  TASK: Extract 'What We Found'.
  For lab_summary, list SPECIFIC lab values and results (e.g., "Hgb 7.7, Albumin 2.1, Alk Phos 183").
  Do NOT substitute imaging results for lab results.
  For findings, summarize NEW clinical findings or current disease status from this visit.
  Respond *only* with a JSON object using this exact schema:
  {
  "Type_of_Cancer": "list the type of cancer",
  "Stage_of_Cancer": "list the stage if it is written in the note",
  "Distant Metastasis": "if there is distant metastasis (met). Yes, to where; No, local, not sure, need more evidence such as imaging.",
  "Metastasis": "if there is met, Yes (to where), No, or Not sure",
  "lab_summary": "Summary of key lab results with specific values. Only include laboratory tests (blood work), NOT imaging.",
  "findings": "Summary of new findings or disease status."
  }

Treatment_Summary: |
  TASK: Extract 'Treatment Summary'.
  Respond *only* with a JSON object using this exact schema:
  {
  "current_meds": "List of current oncologic medications or regimens.",
  "recent_changes": "Any holds, dose reductions, or switches.",
  "supportive_meds": "List of supportive medications."
  }

Goals_of_care: |
  TASK: Extract 'What We Discussed / Decided'.

  For response_assessment, look for:
  - Imaging results: "CT shows stable disease", "PET-CT shows progression", "MRI stable"
  - Tumor markers: "CA 15-3 decreased/increased/stable", "CEA trending down"
  - Clinical assessment: "no evidence of disease recurrence", "probable PD", "compatible with treatment response", "exam stable"
  - Symptom-based: "symptoms worsening", "pain improved", "tolerating therapy well"
  If the patient is newly diagnosed and has NOT yet started treatment, write "Not yet on treatment — no response to assess."
  If there is no mention of disease status or treatment response anywhere in the note, write "Not mentioned in note."
  Do NOT write "Not applicable" or "Not specified".

  Respond *only* with a JSON object using this exact schema:
  {
  "goals_of_treatment": "The stated goal or intent of treatment, e.g., curative, palliative, risk reduction, symptom management.",
  "response_assessment": "How is the cancer responding? Cite specific evidence: imaging findings, lab trends, or clinical status. e.g., 'CT stable, CA 15-3 decreased from 28 to 14' or 'no evidence of disease recurrence on imaging and exam'."
  }
