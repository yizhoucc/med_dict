      "Patient Name: ***** *****  ***** *****: 08/22/19    ***** ***** is a 45 year old female with recently diagnosed breast cancer who is here for a consultation regarding further management.

Physical Exam:  This was a video visit    Impression  ***** clinical prognostic stage IIIB (*****) left breast cancer, ER/PR positive, ***** negative    Assessment/Plan:  Status of disease and management recommendations were discussed at length with *****. She has a cancer that is locally advanced. The rib finding on the PET scan may or may not be a site of metastasis, but it is too subtle and too late to attempt a biopsy with high confidence. Therefore I think the stage IIIB staging is reasonable to pursue at this time. Should more convincing and accessible sites of distant metastasis present themselves in the future, this can be pursued with the appropriate diagnostic biopsies and the stage revised if necessary.    ***** has a high risk of systemic relapse and mortality from this cancer if it is managed by surgery alone, a risk that I estimate to be greater than 80%. This can be reduced by several modalities including chemotherapy, hormone therapy, bone therapy, radiotherapy, and possibly newer modalities under investigation. These were discussed individually.     Chemotherapy can substantially reduced her risk of recurrence and mortality from this cancer and was recommended. Chemotherapy can be \n",
      " administered in the adjuvant or neoadjuvant settings with equivalent benefits on long term outcomes outcomes (***** ***** *****; ***** ***** *****; ***** ***** *****). However there are certain advantages to the neoadjuvant timing.

She has already started on neo-adjuvant AC/taxol chemotherapy and I concurred with this (***** ***** *****; ***** ***** *****). This consists of 4 cycles of AC at 60/600 mg/m2 given every 2 weeks with growth factor support followed by taxol given either in 4 doses of 175mg/m2 q2weeks or in 12 weekly doses of 80mg/m2. Side effects were discussed including a potential for nausea, vomiting, alopecia, immune suppression and infections, fatigue, neuropathy. Long term sequelae include 1-2% incidence of cardiomyopathy (***** ***** *****; ***** ***** *****) and 0.5% incidence of secondary myeloid neoplasms (***** ***** *****).     ***** will be having surgery after the completion of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. Considering her locally advanced disease, it may be wise to perform an axillary dissection, and if feasible, to identify and remove the subpectoral LNs as well. The feasibility of this is best determined by ***** and may require a repeat scan post-chemo to determine the extent of residual macroscopic disease. ***** refer to ***** at ***** should she wish to pursue surgery here.     ***** will benefit from adjuvant hormonal therapy for a duration of up to 10 years. Both tamoxifen and AIs are effective with AIs showing superior efficacy \n",
      " in randomized trials (***** ***** *****)(***** ***** *****). Side effects of tamoxifen were discussed including potential for hot flashes, mood effects, increased incidence of thromboembolic events and endometrial cancer in postmenopausal women. Side effects of AIs were discussed including *****, myalgias, and potential acceleration of bone loss. Although AIs are restricted to the postmenopausal state, ***** has high risk disease and will benefit from the superior efficacy afforded by AIs. This was confirmed in the combined analysis of the SOFT and TEXT trials wherein ovarian suppression with aromatase inhibitor therapy was the optimal hormonal therapy modality in premenopausal patients (***** ***** *****). ***** will likely be peri-menopausal at the completion of chemotherapy and may require ovarian suppression for a period of time. Alternatively ***** therapy with continuous estradiol monitoring for a period of time may establish a permanent menopausal status without the need for suppression.    The bone loss associated with postmenopausal use of AIs can be ***** with anti-resorptive bone agents. In addition to beneficial effects on bone, the use of ***** or denosumab every 6 months for 3 years in post-menopausal patients with early stage breast cancer is associated with a significant reduction in breast cancer recurrence (***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** *****), providing additional benefit to their use in this patient population. Side effects of zoledronic acid and denosumab were discussed including a rare risk of ***** with no cases confirmed in the *****-12 or *****-18 studies (***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** *****), but 2% in the more intense schedule of the ***** trial (***** ***** *****), and a rare risk of atypical femoral fractures at a rate of under 0.2% (***** ***** *****) with no cases confirmed in the *****-18 study (***** ***** *****). Zoledronic infusions \n",
      " can also be associated with flu-like symptoms typically with the first infusion.    In addition, we discussed the emerging role of ***** inhibitor therapy in the treatment of ER positive breast cancer. The addition of ***** inhibitors is associated with significant DFS and survival benefit in patients with metastatic breast cancer (***** ***** *****; ***** ***** *****). Phase 3 studies in early stage breast cancer have been completed but the outcomes data are not yet available. Press releases from ***** and ***** ***** have reported mixed results for adjuvant palbociclib and abemaciclib. This may be due to differences in risk categories accrued or may be due to differences in the agents or other study designs and can only be intelligently evaluated when the data is presented or published. The ribociclib phase 3 study is open at ***** (*****) and this remains an option should it still be open to accrual when ***** reaches her hormone therapy period. Alternatively ***** inhibitors may be used off label in this high risk case with her knowledge and consent.    ***** will benefit from post-operative radiotherapy whether she ***** breast-conserving surgery or mastectomy.  The high risk nature of her disease including the extensive LN involvement portend a high risk of local relapse and mortality that can be reduced by RT even in the post-mastectomy setting (***** ***** *****). In addition to the treatment of the breast or chest wall and regional LNs, ***** may chose to treat the semi-suspicious left lateral rib lesion with stereotactic RT. Indeed the management of oligometastatic breast cancer with stereotactic radiation approaches can result in considerable durations of disease control and survival, ***** when the oligometastatic site is in bone (***** ***** *****)(***** ***** *****)(***** ***** *****)(***** Int J Radiat ***** Biol Phys 2019; 104:1194).    ***** will be continuing her \n",

Cardiovascular: Negative.    Gastrointestinal: Positive for nausea and vomiting. Negative for constipation and diarrhea.   Skin: Negative for itching and rash.   Neurological: Negative for dizziness, weakness and headaches.     Physical Exam:  This was a video visit    Impression  ***** clinical prognostic stage IIIB (*****) left breast cancer, ER/PR positive, ***** negative    Assessment/Plan:  Status of disease and management recommendations were discussed at length with *****. She has a cancer that is locally advanced. The rib finding on the PET scan may or may not be a site of metastasis, but it is too subtle and too late to attempt a biopsy with high confidence. Therefore I think the stage IIIB staging is reasonable to pursue at this time. Should more convincing and accessible sites of distant metastasis present themselves in the future, this can be pursued with the appropriate diagnostic biopsies and the stage revised if necessary.    ***** has a high risk of systemic relapse and mortality from this cancer if it is managed by surgery alone, a risk that I estimate to be greater than 80%. This can be reduced by several modalities including chemotherapy, hormone therapy, bone therapy, radiotherapy, and possibly newer modalities under investigation. These were discussed individually.     Chemotherapy can substantially reduced her risk of recurrence and mortality from this cancer and was recommended. Chemotherapy can be \\n administered in the adjuvant or neoadjuvant settings with equivalent benefits on long term outcomes outcomes (***** ***** *****; ***** ***** *****; ***** ***** *****). However there are certain advantages to the neoadjuvant timing. These include the opportunity to confirm the in ***** response, the powerful prognostic information provided by pathologic response status (***** ***** *****; ***** ***** *****; ***** ***** *****; ***** ***** *****; ***** ***** *****), and the opportunity for salvage therapies or clinical trials should there be extensive residual disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy ***** a high risk of relapse.  She has already started on neo-adjuvant AC/taxol chemotherapy and I concurred with this (***** ***** *****; ***** ***** *****). This consists of 4 cycles of AC at 60/600 mg/m2 given every 2 weeks with growth factor support followed by taxol given either in 4 doses of 175mg/m2 q2weeks or in 12 weekly doses of 80mg/m2. Side effects were discussed including a potential for nausea, vomiting, alopecia, immune suppression and infections, fatigue, neuropathy. Long term sequelae include 1-2% incidence of cardiomyopathy (***** ***** *****; ***** ***** *****) and 0.5% incidence of secondary myeloid neoplasms (***** ***** *****).     ***** will be having surgery after the completion of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. Considering her locally advanced disease, it may be wise to perform an axillary dissection, and if feasible, to identify and remove the subpectoral LNs as well. The feasibility of this is best determined by ***** and may require a repeat scan post-chemo to determine the extent of residual macroscopic disease. ***** refer to ***** at ***** should she wish to pursue surgery here.     ***** will benefit from adjuvant hormonal therapy for a duration of up to 10 years. Both tamoxifen and AIs are effective with AIs showing superior efficacy \\n in randomized trials (***** ***** *****)(***** ***** *****). Side effects of tamoxifen were discussed including potential for hot flashes, mood effects, increased incidence of thromboembolic events and endometrial cancer in postmenopausal women. Side effects of AIs were discussed including *****, myalgias, and potential acceleration of bone loss. Although AIs are restricted to the postmenopausal state, ***** has high risk disease and will benefit from the superior efficacy afforded by AIs. This was confirmed in the combined analysis of the SOFT and TEXT trials wherein ovarian suppression with aromatase inhibitor therapy was the optimal hormonal therapy modality in premenopausal patients (***** ***** *****). ***** will likely be peri-menopausal at the completion of chemotherapy and may require ovarian suppression for a period of time. Alternatively ***** therapy with continuous estradiol monitoring for a period of time may establish a permanent menopausal status without the need for suppression.    The bone loss associated with postmenopausal use of AIs can be ***** with anti-resorptive bone agents. In addition to beneficial effects on bone, the use of ***** or denosumab every 6 months for 3 years in post-menopausal patients with early stage breast cancer is associated with a significant reduction in breast cancer recurrence (***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** *****), providing additional benefit to their use in this patient population. Side effects of zoledronic acid and denosumab were discussed including a rare risk of ***** with no cases confirmed in the *****-12 or *****-18 studies (***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** *****), but 2% in the more intense schedule of the ***** trial (***** ***** *****), and a rare risk of atypical femoral fractures at a rate of under 0.2% (***** ***** *****) with no cases confirmed in the *****-18 study (***** ***** *****). Zoledronic infusions \\n can also be associated with flu-like symptoms typically with the first infusion.    In addition, we discussed the emerging role of ***** inhibitor therapy in the treatment of ER positive breast cancer. The addition of ***** inhibitors is associated with significant DFS and survival benefit in patients with metastatic breast cancer (***** ***** *****; ***** ***** *****). Phase 3 studies in early stage breast cancer have been completed but the outcomes data are not yet available. Press releases from ***** and ***** ***** have reported mixed results for adjuvant palbociclib and abemaciclib. This may be due to differences in risk categories accrued or may be due to differences in the agents or other study designs and can only be intelligently evaluated when the data is presented or published. The ribociclib phase 3 study is open at ***** (*****) and this remains an option should it still be open to accrual when ***** reaches her hormone therapy period. Alternatively ***** inhibitors may be used off label in this high risk case with her knowledge and consent.    ***** will benefit from post-operative radiotherapy whether she ***** breast-conserving surgery or mastectomy.  The high risk nature of her disease including the extensive LN involvement portend a high risk of local relapse and mortality that can be reduced by RT even in the post-mastectomy setting (***** ***** *****). In addition to the treatment of the breast or chest wall and regional LNs, ***** may chose to treat the semi-suspicious left lateral rib lesion with stereotactic RT. Indeed the management of oligometastatic breast cancer with stereotactic radiation approaches can result in considerable durations of disease control and survival, ***** when the oligometastatic site is in bone (***** ***** *****)(***** ***** *****)(***** ***** *****)(***** Int J Radiat ***** Biol Phys 2019; 104:1194).    ***** will be continuing her \\n management at ***** and will return to us as needed for additional consultations. Today's consultation was based on the available medical records. Slides or images were not provided or reviewed for confirmation of the reported findings.     Seen and discussed with Dr. ***** *****    ***** performed this consultation using real-time Telehealth tools, including a live video connection between my location and the patient's location.
