She had a mastectomy with sentinel node and implant reconstruction in June 2013 and had  2.3 and 2.4 cm tumors found with a negative sentinel node.  The tumors were G2,  ER and PR positive and her 2 neu negative.  She did not have radiation or chemotherapy and declined tamoxifen.  She has had ***** but no other imaging since her diagnosis for screening and was treated at *****.     She reports feeling discomfort and pressure in her waist and back for a few months and nausea and burping for a week.  She went to the ER and had a CT scan which shows widely metastatic cancer.  She has involvement of the lungs, peritoneum, liver and ovary with a local recurrence near the right axilla and implant.  She takes a long list of supplements which she will send to me.  She wants to have natural therapies.  She is very scared and appears anxious.  Her husband is here and very supportive.  We discussed how we need to get a biopsy to evaluate the phenotype of the cancer and she is agreeable.  I will set her up to see Dr. \\n ***** this week for a biopsy of the right axilla in the office.  We discussed how treatment would be palliative but that treatment could improve her quality of life as well as length of life.  She asked me multiple times if this can be cured.

    "STRICT NEGATIVE CONSTRAINT: Under NO circumstances should you say something not exist in the note.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Letter Structure and Flow:** Organize your letter logically to guide the patient through the information without overwhelming them. Follow this structure:\n",
    "    * **Empathetic Opening:** Start with a short warm and supportive salutation. Acknowledge the reason for their recent visit and the stress they might be feeling. \n",
    "    * **STRICT NEGATIVE CONSTRAINT:** AVOID LENGTHY OPENINGS. 1 sentence maxiumm.\n",
    "    * **Summary of Past History:** Briefly recap their initial diagnosis and treatment. **Crucial rule: When discussing past treatment decisions, use neutral, non-judgmental language. Avoid direct phrases like \"you chose not to\" or \"you refused.\" Instead, use objective phrasing like \"At that time, the treatment plan did not include...\" or \"The decision was made not to proceed with...\" to describe past events.**\n",
    "    * **Explanation of Current Findings:** Describe what the recent tests (like the CT scan) have shown. Use simple, everyday language. Use analogies if helpful. **After providing a simple explanation (e.g., 'the cancer has spread'), avoid immediately following it with blunt, technical classifications. However, we want to highight the cancer stage if the note mentioned, and explain the stage meaning immediately after mentioning. Prioritize the compassionate explanation over the clinical label in the letter's flow.**\n",

    "    * **STRICT NEGATIVE CONSTRAINT:** If the cancer has spread (metastasis), absolutely DO NOT list the specific organs affected. Instead, just say \"the cancer has spread to other parts of your body.\"\n",
    "    * **The Go-Forward Plan:** Detail the next steps you have planned. For each step (like a biopsy, MRI, or bone scan), explain **WHAT** it is, and more importantly, **WHY** you are doing it.\n",
    "    * **Treatment Goals and Philosophy:** This is the most important section. If the medical note mentions the term \"palliative,\" explain this concept with extreme care. define it as an active and positive treatment approach focused on controlling the cancer, managing symptoms, and improving quality of life. The entire focus must be on the quality and extension of life.    \n",
    "    * **STRICT NEGATIVE CONSTRAINT:** Under NO circumstances use fatalistic or terminal language. Absolutely AVOID phrases like \"until the end of your life,\" \"preparing for the end,\" \"however many that may be\", or any language that focuses on dying. The entire focus of this paragraph MUST be on the quality and extension of LIFE.**\n",
    "    * **STRICT NEGATIVE CONSTRAINT:** AVOID LENGTHY comforting sentences and too much sympathy. The letter should be concise and focused on key information.\n",
